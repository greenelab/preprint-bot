    title: Immune profile of children with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2
      infection (Long Covid)
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: There is increasing reporting by patients organization and researchers
      of long covid (or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 - PASC), characterized
      by symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive and sleeping
      disturbances, arthralgia and decline in quality of life. Immune system
      dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity,
      endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as
      pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been
      reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia. However, immunological studies of
      children with PASC have never been performed. In this study, we documented
      significant immunologic differences between children that completely
      recovered from acute infection and those with PASC, providing the first
      objective laboratory sign of the existence of PASC in children.

    raw_message: Interesting paper! I have one comment though. I am noticing an
      increasing number of papers using the term post-exertional malaise (PEM)
      without providing any definition of what this condition represents. This
      is important because PEM is not a term widely known in the medical
      community and it has a distinct presentation. PEM is the worsening of a
      variety of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion and
      moreover, the severity of the impact is often delayed by hours or days and
      can take days, weeks or months to recover from. The reason why PEM is not
      widely known is because it is the cardinal symptom of the disease ME/CFS
      which has been significantly ignored and underfunded. PEM is unique to
      ME/CFS and any mention of PEM should really provide appropriate references
      to ME/CFS literature.

    abstract: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is devastating the modern
      societies worldwide, many variants that naturally acquire multiple
      mutations have emerged. Emerging mutations can affect viral properties
      such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of
      naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has recently
      been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted
      cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that two
      recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
      spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape
      from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce
      the affinity to viral receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation
      increases protein stability, viral infectivity, and potentially promotes
      viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLA-restricted cellular
      immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and the
      escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic.

    title: Multi-centre derivation and validation of a colitis-associated cancer
      risk prediction web-tool
    category: gastroenterology
    abstract: >-
      ObjectiveUlcerative colitis (UC) patients diagnosed with low-grade
      dysplasia (LGD) have increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia (AN;
      high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer). We aimed to develop and
      validate a predictor of AN risk in UC patients with LGD and create a
      visual web-tool to effectively communicate the risk.


      DesignIn our retrospective multi-centre validated cohort study, adult UC patients with an index diagnosis of LGD, identified from four UK centres between 2001-2019, were followed until progression to AN. In the discovery cohort (n=246), a multivariate risk prediction model was derived from clinicopathological features using Cox regression. Validation used data from 3 external centres (n=198). The validated model was embedded in a web-tool to calculate patient-specific risk.


      ResultsFour clinicopathological variables were significantly associated with AN progression in the discovery cohort: endoscopically visible LGD > 1 cm (HR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.2-5.9), unresectable or incomplete endoscopic resection (HR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.6-7.4), moderate/severe histological inflammation within 5 years of LGD diagnosis (HR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.7), and multifocality (HR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.2). In the validation cohort, this 4-variable model accurately predicted future AN cases with overall calibration Observed/Expected = 1 (95% CI 0.63-1.5), and achieved 100% specificity for the lowest risk group over 13 years of available follow-up.


      ConclusionMulti-cohort validation confirms that patients with large, unresected, multifocal LGD and recent moderate/severe inflammation are at highest risk of developing AN. Personalised risk prediction provided via the Ulcerative Colitis-Cancer Risk Estimator (www.UC-CaRE.uk) can support treatment decision-making.


      SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe risk of ulcerative colitis-associated low-grade dysplasia (LGD) progression to more advanced neoplasia is currently not clearly defined. The literature consists of historical data from small heterogenous observational studies with limited follow-up or lack of information on endoscopic resection status.

      C_LI


      What are the new findings?O_LIWe present the results from the largest multi-centre cohort study to evaluate LGD long-term prognosis based on clinicopathological factors that are reflective of modern surveillance techniques.

      C_LIO_LIRecent moderate or severe active inflammation or LGD that is large, not fully resectable or is multifocal remain independent predictors of advanced neoplasia progression, even when stratified to reflect the most modern era of high definition endoscopic imaging, chromoendoscopy and advanced polypectomy techniques.

      C_LIO_LIColorectal cancer incidence after endoscopic resection of unifocal polypoid and non-polypoid dysplasia is 0.6 per 100 patient-years.

      C_LIO_LILong-term incidence of advanced neoplasia is similar if LGD is invisible or if LGD is visible but not completely endoscopically resected.

      C_LIO_LIUsing these data, we have designed and externally validated a cancer risk prediction tool for ulcerative colitis patients with LGD.

      C_LI


      How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?O_LIThe UC-CaRE (Ulcerative Colitis-Cancer Risk Estimator) tool can be used to calculate and communicate individualised numerical cancer risk estimates to colitis patients with LGD.

      C_LIO_LIIt facilitates the risk stratification of the lowest-risk patients, who can be reassured by undergoing continued surveillance, and those at the highest-risk who may benefit from a prophylactic colectomy.

      C_LIO_LIThis visual aid presents the calculated risk in a graphical and pictorial form to optimise risk comprehension and informed treatment choices.

    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable clinical efficacy,
      but questions remain about the nature and kinetics of T cell priming. We
      performed longitudinal antigen-specific T cell analyses in healthy
      individuals following mRNA vaccination. Vaccination induced rapid
      near-maximal antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in all subjects after
      the first vaccine dose. CD8+ T cell responses developed gradually after
      the first and second dose and were variable. Vaccine-induced T cells had
      central memory characteristics and included both Tfh and Th1 subsets,
      similar to natural infection. Th1 and Tfh responses following the first
      dose predicted post-boost CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody levels,
      respectively. Integrated analysis of 26 antigen-specific T cell and
      humoral responses revealed coordinated features of the immune response to
      vaccination. Lastly, whereas booster vaccination improved CD4+ and CD8+ T
      cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects, the second vaccine dose had
      little effect on T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals.
      Thus, longitudinal analysis revealed robust T cell responses to mRNA
      vaccination and highlighted early induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T
      cells.

    title: "The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries
      during the COVID-19 pandemic"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or
      across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths
      can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess
      mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the
      recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the
      COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central,
      frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across
      countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or
      quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as
      the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to
      compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality
      increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by
      over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID
      mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been
      reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been
      underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more.
      Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the world's COVID-19
      death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of
      confirmed deaths.

    title: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response through
      cGAS-STING and NF-κB
    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global
      pandemic. In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild
      disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals
      develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death.
      These severe cases are often associated with high levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to
      systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine
      secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct
      upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from
      infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific
      activation of NF-κB and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in
      SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-κB response is mediated by cGAS-STING
      activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our
      results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-κB driven
      inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes
      to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to
      suppress severe disease symptoms.

    title: Leptin regulates glucose homeostasis via the canonical WNT pathway.
    category: physiology
    abstract: Leptin is a body weight regulatory hormone, but it is arguably even
      more potent at regulating blood glucose levels. To further our
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which leptin controls glucose
      homeostasis, we have used transgenic zebrafish models and conditional
      deletion of beta catenin in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice to
      show that Wnt signalling in the brain mediates glucoregulatory effects of
      leptin. In zebrafish, under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates
      glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis. In times of nutrient excess, we
      found that leptin also regulates body weight and size in this species.
      Using a Wnt signalling reporter fish, we show that leptin directly
      activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of
      this pathway prevented the leptin-induced improvement in glucose
      tolerance. In adult mice, conditional deletion of the key Wnt effector
      molecule, {beta}-catenin, in the mediobasal hypothalamus of male mice
      confirmed the essential role of the Wnt pathway in mediating leptin action
      and the neuroendocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis. Adult-onset
      {beta}-catenin deletion in the mediobasal hypothalamus led to glucose
      intolerance, exacerbation of caloric intake and body weight gain under
      high fat diet, as well as resistance to exogenous leptin.

      Hello,


      Thanks so much for an amazing paper on leptin and the canonical WNT pathway. Overall, the paper was a very interesting read, and I learned a lot about the subject area. Here are some suggestions/comments regarding the figures and experiments you performed:


      - Figure 1 does not show how pyrvinium pamoate affects the canonical WNT pathway through fluorescence intensity. Although the paper mentions that pyrvinium pamoate inhibits the pathway, it would be more effective to show this effect through the transgenic zebrafish.

      - It would be best to move Figure 1E and 1F to supplementary to create more space for the fluorescent images.

      - Figure 2 should be broken into two separate figures. This also allows you to display the results on leptin-a and leptin-b deficient zebrafish for the glucose immersion experiment. This will also give you a chance to increase the size of the graphs for better visualization.  

      - For figure 4J, explicitly mention what pre and post-treatment refer to. I know that the figure legend explains it, but it would be best to have it directly on the figure.

      - Overall, the experiments were very well conducted. I am convinced that leptin regulates glucose homeostasis through the canonical WNT pathway. Nonetheless, for the glucose immersion and overfeeding experiments, adipose tissue level should have also been measured to show that leptin does not regulate adipostasis in zebrafish.  


      Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I hope these comments can be of some help to your paper!

    title: Site-specific epigenetic marks in Trypanosoma brucei transcription
      termination, antigenic variation, and proliferation
    category: genetics
    abstract: In Trypanosoma brucei, genes assemble into polycistronic transcription
      units (PTUs). Transcription termination sites (TTSs) hold deposition sites
      for three non-essential chromatin factors, histone variants (H3v and H4v)
      and a DNA modification (base J, a hydroxyl-glucosyl dT). Here, I found
      that H4v is a major sign for transcription termination at TTSs and
      readthrough transcription machineries progress until they encounter the
      next bidirectional transcription start site. While having a secondary
      function at TTSs, H3v is important for monoallelic transcription of
      telomeric antigen genes. The simultaneous absence of both histone variants
      leads to proliferation and replication defects, which are exacerbated by
      the J deficiency, accompanied by accumulation of sub-G1 population. Base J
      likely contributes to DNA replication and cell-cycle control. I propose
      that the coordinated actions of H3v, H4v and J function in concert for
      cellular fate determination and provide compensatory mechanisms for each
      other in chromatin organization, transcription, and replication.

      Excellent work!


      I am very curious about the VSG expression patterns in your DKO and TKO cells. In Figure 6D, did you account for differences in read mappability? Since some genes have more 'unique sequence' than others, mappability may affect your RPKM.

    abstract: As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome
      sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and
      evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of variants of concern
      (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part
      of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike
      protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken
      to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current
      circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant
      clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617
      possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G
      and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding
      domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and
      681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The
      structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in
      the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in
      increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better
      transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding
      to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization
      potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera
      from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be
      studied. The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of
      convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further
      investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and
      its possibility of becoming a VOC.

    title: Opioid Prescribing Mediating State Policy Intervention Effects on Drug
      Overdose Mortality
    category: health-policy
    abstract: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 70 630 drug
      overdose deaths for 2019 in the United States, 70.5% of which were
      opioid-related. Preliminary estimates now warn that drug overdose deaths
      likely surpassed 86 000 during 2020. Despite a 57.4% decrease in opioid
      prescribing since a peak in 2012, the opioid death rate has increased
      105.8% through 2019, as the share of those deaths involving fentanyl
      increased from 16.4% to 72.9%. This letter seeks to determine whether the
      opioid prescribing and mortality paradox is robust to accepted methods of
      causal policy analysis and if prescribing rates mediate the effects of
      policy interventions on overdose deaths. Using loge-loge ordinary least
      squares with three different specifications as sensitivity analyses for
      all 50 states and Washington, DC for the period 2001-2019, the
      elasticities from the regressions with all control variables report
      operational prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce
      prescribing rates 8.7%, while mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from
      opioids 16.6%, heroin and fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs
      10.5%. There is also weak evidence that recreational marijuana laws reduce
      prescribing, increases in prescribing increase pain reliever deaths, pill
      mill laws increase cocaine deaths, and medical marijuana laws increase
      total overdose deaths, with demographic variables suggesting states with
      more male, less non-Hispanic white, and older citizens experience more
      overdoses. Weak mediation effects were observed for pain reliever,
      cocaine, and illicit opioid deaths, while broad reductions in prescribing
      have failed to reduce opioid overdoses.

      In your paper you write 



      "drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce prescribing rates 8.7%, while 

      mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from opioids 16.6%, heroin and 

      fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs 10.5%" 


      This phrasing seems to assert demonstrated cause and effect.  It is not at all clear to me that the techniques you are applying have the capability to establish that. 


      Likewise, there is an important question in this process that you do not address and I would hope you may be willing to attempt:  recognizing that predominant modes of overdose mortality involve multiple legal and illegal opioids in the great majority of deaths, is the contribution of opioids prescribed by doctors to their patients (not diverted) statistically significant  in the overall mortality rate due to all opioids, legal and illegal? Based on the relative rarity of addiction to medically managed prescription opioids,  I would suggest that it is not.

    title: Cytosolic localization and in vitro assembly of human de novo thymidylate
      synthesis complex
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: "De novo thymidylate synthesis is a crucial pathway for normal and
      cancer cells. Deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) is synthesized by the
      combined action of three enzymes: serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT),
      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS), the latter
      two targets of widely used chemotherapeutics such as antifolates and
      5-fluorouracil. These proteins translocate to the nucleus after
      SUMOylation and are suggested to assemble in this compartment into the
      thymidylate synthesis complex (dTMP-SC). We report the intracellular
      dynamics of the complex in lung cancer cells by in situ proximity ligation
      assay, showing that it is also detected in the cytoplasm. This result
      strongly indicates that the role of the dTMP-SC assembly may go beyond
      dTMP synthesis. We have successfully assembled the dTMP synthesis complex
      in vitro, employing tetrameric SHMT1 and a bifunctional chimeric enzyme
      comprising human TYMS and DHFR. We show that the SHMT1 tetrameric state is
      required for efficient complex assembly, indicating that this aggregation
      state is evolutionary selected in eukaryotes to optimize protein-protein
      interactions. Lastly, our results on the activity of the complete
      thymidylate cycle in vitro, may provide a useful tool to develop drugs
      targeting the entire complex instead of the individual components."

    title: Stability of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy and its importance
      for early infant colonization
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Early life microbiota has been linked to the development of chronic
      inflammatory diseases. It has been hypothesized that maternal vaginal
      microbiota is an important initial seeding source and therefore can have
      lifelong effects on disease risk. To understand maternal vaginal
      microbiota's role in seeding the child's microbiota and the extent of
      delivery mode-dependent transmission, we studied 700 mother-child dyads
      from the COPSAC2010 cohort. The maternal vaginal microbiota was evaluated
      in the third trimester and compared with the children's fecal and airway
      microbiota. The vaginal samples displayed known stable community state
      types and only 1:6 changed over time. Only one OTU were significantly
      transferred to children's fecal compartment, but an inflated number had
      positive transfer odds. A few taxonomic families showed early transfer
      enrichment to vaginally-born children, indicating vertical transfer, while
      half of the observed transfer effects were delivery mode independent
      enrichment with attenuating strength over time, indicating a common
      reservoir.

    abstract: Several vaccines have demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
      mediated disease, yet there is limited data on the immune response induced
      by heterologous vaccination regimens using alternate vaccine modalities.
      Here, we present a detailed description of the immune response, in mice,
      following vaccination with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine and an
      adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2.
      We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in two dose heterologous
      vaccination regimens than single dose regimens. Neutralising titres after
      heterologous prime-boost were at least comparable or higher than the
      titres measured after homologous prime boost vaccination with viral
      vectors. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous
      regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells which is
      superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in
      mice. These results underpin the need for clinical trials to investigate
      the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens with alternate vaccine
      technologies.

    title: A more accurate method for colocalisation analysis allowing for multiple
      causal variants
    category: genetics
    abstract: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) it is now common to search
      for, and find, multiple causal variants located in close proximity. It has
      also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal
      variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc,
      makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists
      for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential
      of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression
      framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use
      with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association
      at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst
      separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the
      causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate
      coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal
      variants based on conditioning or masking. We therefore recommend that
      coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of
      colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.

      Thank you for taking the time to review.  I haven't had a public review
      before to my knowledge, but they seem a thoroughly good thing.  I am not
      sure of the conventions, but hope it is in the right spirit to post a
      summary of my responses to each of your main points, which I think have
      improved the manuscript.  The changes I describe may be seen in version 2
      on biorxiv.


      1. I have adjusted coloc to use the Bayes factors that are now returned by susie_rss (thank you), so the back-calculation is no longer needed and I have removed that equation. I have also updated the relevant text to give more details on how susie_rss is called, and the number of colocalisation comparisons returned and how the pairwise probabilities of colocalisation may be interpreted.





      2. I completely agree it would be cheating to tell any method how many causal variants were simulated! I have updated the legend to figure 3, which hopefully clarifies what AA, BB etc signals are. 





      In the setting where each trait has 2 causal variants A and B, there should ideally be 4 comparisons: AA, AB, BA, BB.  Very occasionally there are more (a handful of times susie_rss reports > 2 signals).  Often there are fewer (due to power), and even when there are 4, they may not all be assignable to labelled groups and some will fall in “?”. This is why the bar height, which is proportional to the number of comparisons performed in a given category divided by the number of simulations, doesn’t reach 1.





      3. Figure 1 has now been changed to show both the change in PIP at the causal variants and at the non-causal variants. Specifically, following the approach of coloc to consider comparisons between vectors of Bayes factors corresponding to detected credible sets, I took the colSums of obj$alpha[ obj$sets$cs_index, ] as a measure of the total PIP after a run of susie_rss(). Thus the total PIP can increase/decrease by 1 if a credible set is “discovered” or “lost” after trimming.  This view of the data shows false positives are indeed introduced after trimming. This is now described at the beginning of the Results section





      Fig 3 shows, however, that despite these false positives coloc with SuSiE outperforms the alternatives, and appears to do at least as well when trimming as not. Therefore, I expanded the Discussion on trimming to give a clearer warning that while trimming is possible for coloc, these results do not support its use in fine-mapping. 





      4. Thank you for these detailed explanations. I agree it would be preferable to never trim data. I have extended the discussion to cover these points, and acknowledged your comments in helping me to do that.

    title: HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: >-
      BackgroundSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of
      severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA)
      have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to
      evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study
      using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation.


      MethodsWe analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240).


      ResultsWe identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.


      ConclusionsHLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.

    title: bootComb - An R Package to Derive Confidence Intervals for Combinations
      of Independent Parameter Estimates
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Motivation. The epidemiologist sometimes needs to combine several
      independent parameter estimates: e.g. (i) adjust an incidence rate for
      healthcare utilisation, (ii) derive a disease prevalence from the
      conditional prevalence on another condition and the prevalence of that
      condition, (iii) adjust a seroprevalence for test sensitivity and
      specificity. While obtaining the combined parameter estimate is usually
      straightforward, deriving a corresponding confidence interval often is
      not. bootComb is an R package using parametric bootstrap sampling to
      derive such confidence intervals. Implementation. bootComb is a package
      for the statistical computation environment R. General features. As well
      as a function that returns confidence intervals for parameters combined
      from several independent estimates, bootComb provides auxiliary functions
      for 6 common distributions (beta, normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson and
      negative binomial) to derive best-fit distributions (and their sampling
      functions) for parameters given their reported confidence intervals.
      Availability. bootComb is available from the Comprehensive R Archive
      Network (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bootComb)."

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative pathogen
      of the COVID-19 pandemic which as of Nov 15, 2020 has claimed 1,319,946
      lives worldwide. Vaccine development focuses on the viral trimeric spike
      glycoprotein as the main target of the humoral immune response. Viral
      spikes carry glycans that facilitate immune evasion by shielding specific
      protein epitopes from antibody neutralisation. Immunogen integrity is
      therefore important for glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates. Here we
      show how site-specific glycosylation differs between virus-derived spikes
      and spike proteins derived from a viral vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
      candidate. We show that their cellular secretion pathways are unique,
      resulting in different protein glycosylation and secretion, which may have
      implications for the resulting immune response and future vaccine design.

    title: YhcB (DUF1043), a novel cell division protein conserved across
      gamma-proteobacteria
    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      YhcB, an uncharacterized protein conserved across gamma-proteobacteria, is
      composed predominantly of a single Domain of Unknown Function (DUF 1043)
      with an N-terminal transmembrane -helix. Here, we show that E. coli YhcB
      is a conditionally essential protein that interacts with the proteins of
      the cell divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). We
      found 7 interactions of YhcB that are conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or
      Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we identified several point mutations that
      abolished interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The yhcB knock-out
      strain does not grow at 45{degrees}C and is hypersensitive to cell-wall
      acting antibiotics even in stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to
      filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septa
      development. The 2.8 [A] crystal structure for the cytosolic domain from
      Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric -helical coiled-coil
      structure that combines parallel and anti-parallel coiled-coil
      intersubunit interactions. This structure is likely to organize
      interprotein oligomeric interactions on the inner surface of the
      cytoplasmic membrane, possibly involved in regulation of cell division
      and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity in proteobacteria. In summary, YhcB
      is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that is predicted to
      play a role in cell division and consequently or in addition affects
      envelope biogenesis.


      ImportanceOnly 0.8 % of the protein annotations in the UniProt are based on experimental evidence and thus, functional characterization of unknown proteins remains a rate-limiting step in molecular biology. Herein, the functional properties of YhcB (DUF1043) were investigated using an integrated approach combining X-ray crystallography with genetics and molecular biology. YhcB is a conserved protein that appears to be needed for the transition from exponential to stationary growth and is involved in cell division and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity. This study will serve as a starting point for future studies on this protein family and on how cells transit from exponential to stationary survival.

    title: Estimated inequities in COVID-19 infection fatality rates by ethnicity
      for Aotearoa New Zealand
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: There is limited evidence as to how COVID-19 infection fatality rates
      (IFR) may vary by ethnicity. We combine demographic and health data for
      ethnic groupings in Aotearoa New Zealand with international data on IFR
      for different age groups to estimate inequities in IFR by ethnicity. We
      find that, if age is the dominant factor determining IFR, estimated IFR
      for M[a]ori is around 50% higher than non-M[a]ori. If underlying health
      conditions are more important than age per se, then estimated IFR for
      M[a]ori is more than 2.5 times that of New Zealand European, and estimated
      IFR for Pasifika is almost double that of New Zealand European. IFRs for
      M[a]ori and Pasifika are likely to be increased above these estimates by
      racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in
      official data. IFR does not account for differences among ethnicities in
      COVID-19 incidence, which could be higher in M[a]ori and Pasifika as a
      result of crowded housing and higher inter-generational contact rates.
      These factors should be included in future disease incidence modelling.
      The communities at the highest risk will be those with elderly
      populations, and M[a]ori and Pasifika communities, where the compounded
      effects of underlying health conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, and
      structural racism result in imbricated risk of contracting COVID-19,
      becoming unwell, and death.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

    raw_message: Were the patients randomized into those getting usual and those
      getting 12 week delay?  Having 99 in one group and 73 in the other does
      not seem like a random split of 172 people!  A bias toward giving
      healthier seniors the longer interval might account for some or even all
      of the results.

    title: "Whole-ExM: Expansion microscopy imaging of all anatomical structures of
      whole larval zebrafish"
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: Nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures over whole vertebrates
      is needed for a systematic understanding of human diseases, but this has
      not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate whole-ExM, which enables
      nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures of whole zebrafish larvae
      by labeling the proteins of the larvae with fluorophores and expanding
      them four-fold. We first optimize the fluorophore selection and labeling
      procedure to visualize a broader range of anatomical structures. We then
      develop an expansion protocol for zebrafish larvae having calcified body
      parts. Through this process, we visualize the nanoscale details of diverse
      larvae organs, which have corresponding organ counterparts in humans, over
      the intact larvae. We show that whole-ExM retains the fluorescence signals
      of fluorescent proteins, and its resolution is high enough to visualize
      various structures that can be imaged only with electron microscopy.
      Whole-ExM would enable the nanoscale study of the molecular mechanisms of
      human diseases.

      Congratulations on this beautiful work.


      The ‘unknown structures' that you have imaged in the olfactory epithelium and skin in Suppl. Fig. 32 are rodlet cells, which have been described in several previous papers, including in the zebrafish.  See: 

      Hansen and Zeiske (1998) The Peripheral Olfactory Organ of the Zebrafish, Danio rerio: an Ultrastructural Study.  Chem. Senses 23: 39-48

      DePasquale, J. A. (2020). Tropomyosin and alpha-actinin in teleost rodlet cells. Acta Zool. 00, 1–10. doi: 10.1111/azo.12344


      We included some discussion on rodlet cells in our recent paper on a different cell type, olfactory rod cells, which have a single actin-rich projection (and are also visible in your Suppl. Video 14).  See Cheung et al. (2021).  Olfactory Rod Cells: A Rare Cell Type in the Larval Zebrafish Olfactory Epithelium With a Large Actin-Rich Apical Projection.

    abstract: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens efforts to contain the
      COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has
      risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is
      believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of
      B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which
      interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of
      neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more
      adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered
      two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and
      was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant
      against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally,
      B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although
      with moderate efficiency. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody
      evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.

    title: Wisconsin April 2020 Election Not Associated with Increase in COVID-19
      Infection Rates
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Background: Wisconsin (WI) held a primary election in the midst of
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Live voting at polls was allowed despite concern
      over increasing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to 1.1 million
      absentee ballots cast, 453,222 persons voted live. The purpose of our
      study was to determine if an increase in COVID-19 activity was associated
      with the election. Methods: Using the voting age population for the United
      States (US), WI, and its 3 largest counties, and daily new COVID-19 case
      reports from various COVID-19 web-based dashboards, daily new case rates
      were calculated. With election day April 7, the incubation period included
      April 12-21. The new case activity in the rest of the US was compared with
      the Wisconsin activity during the incubation period. Results: WI daily new
      case rates were lower than those of the rest of the US for the 10-day
      period before the election and remained lower during the post exposure
      incubation period. The ratio of Wisconsin new case rates to US new case
      rates was 0.34 WI: 1 US for the 10 days leading up to the election and
      declined to 0.28 WI: 1 US for the 10-day post-incubation period after the
      election. Similar analysis for Milwaukee county showed a pre-election
      ratio of 1.02 Milwaukee: 1 US and after the election the ratio was 0.63
      Milwaukee: 1 US. Dane county had a pre-election ratio of 0.21 Dane: 1 US
      case, and it fell to 0.13 Dane: 1 US after the election. Waukesha county
      had a pre-election ratio of 0.27 Waukesha: 1 US case and that fell to 0.19
      Waukesha: 1 US after the election. Conclusions: There was no increase in
      COVID-19 new case daily rates observed for Wisconsin or its 3 largest
      counties following the election on April 7, 2020, as compared to the US,
      during the post-incubation interval period."

    title: Metric and chronological time in human episodic memory
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: >-
      The relative contributions of metric and chronological time in the
      encoding of episodic memories are unknown. One hundred one healthy young
      adults viewed 48 unique episodes of visual events and were later tested on
      recall of the order of events (chronological time) and the precise timing
      of events (metric time). The behavioral results show that metric recall
      accuracy correlates with chronological accuracy for events within
      episodes, but does not play a role on larger time-scales across episodes.
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding and recall showed
      that metric time was represented in the posterior medial entorhinal
      cortex, as well as the temporal pole and the cerebellum, whereas
      chronological time was represented in a widespread brain network including
      the anterior lateral entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal
      cortex and the prefrontal cortex. We conclude that metric time has a role
      in episodic memory on short time-scales and is mainly subserved by medial
      temporal lobe structures.

    title: Invasive garlic mustard demonstrates stronger relationships with
      pathotrophic than mycorrhizal fungi
    category: ecology
    abstract: Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) has long been known to degrade
      mycorrhizal mutualisms in soils it invades and may also promote the
      abundance of microbial pathogens harmful to native plants or alter
      saprotrophic communities to disrupt nutrient cycling. Phenology of other
      invasive species, like Lepidium latifolium and Lonicera maackii, plays a
      role in their interactions with soil microbial communities, and so we may
      expect garlic mustard phenology to influence its effects on native soil
      microbiomes as well. Here, we investigate differences in fungal,
      bacterial, and archaeal community structure, as well as the abundance of
      key functional groups, between garlic mustard present, absent, and removed
      treatments in central-Illinois forest soils across different stages of the
      garlic mustard life cycle. Across its phenology, garlic mustard present
      soils had different overall fungal community structure and greater
      abundance of pathotrophic fungi than soils where garlic mustard was absent
      or removed. However, abundance of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi
      as well as bacterial and archaeal community structure were similar between
      treatments and did not interact with garlic mustard phenology. The most
      abundant overall fungal taxon was a plant pathogen, Entorrhiza
      aschersoniana, that was greatest in garlic mustard present soils,
      particularly while the plants were flowering. These results support the
      hypothesis that invasive plants form active relationships with microbial
      pathogens that could contribute to their overall success in invading
      ecosystems.

      Talaromyces marneffei is (we hope!) unlikely to be a common fungus in
      Illinois soils. It is a serious human pathogen that is, so far as we know,
      restricted to southeast Asia, centered on Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Some
      other IDs are equally suspect. Please don't let this get into print.

    abstract: The 2019 outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an
      emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally with high morbidity
      and mortality. Co-circulating seasonal influenza has greatly diminished
      recently, but expected to return with novel strains emerging, thus
      requiring annual strain adjustments. We have developed a recombinant
      hemagglutinin (HA) quadrivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (qNIV)
      produced using an established recombinant insect cell expression system to
      produce nanoparticles. Influenza qNIV adjuvanted with Matrix-M was
      well-tolerated and induced robust antibody and cellular responses, notably
      against both homologous and drifted A/H3N2 viruses in Phase 1, 2, and 3
      trials. We also developed a full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine
      stable in the prefusion conformation (NVX-CoV2373) using the same platform
      technology. In phase 3 clinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic
      and protective against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant. Here we
      describe the immunogenicity and efficacy of a combination quadrivalent
      seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccine (qNIV/CoV2373). In ferret and hamster
      models, qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine produces high titer influenza
      hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) and neutralizing antibodies against
      influenza A and B strains. The combination vaccine also elicited
      antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the human
      angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor. Significantly, hamsters
      immunized with qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were
      protected against weight loss and were free of replicating SARS-CoV-2 in
      the upper and lower respiratory tract with no evidence of viral pneumonia.
      This study supports evaluation of qNIV/CoV2373 combination vaccine as a
      preventive measure for seasonal influenza and CoVID-19.

    title: Plants emit informative airborne sounds under stress
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: Stressed plants show altered phenotypes, including changes in color,
      smell, and shape. Yet, the possibility that plants emit airborne sounds
      when stressed – similarly to many animals – has not been investigated.
      Here we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that stressed plants
      emit airborne sounds that can be recorded remotely, both in acoustic
      chambers and in greenhouses. We recorded ∼65 dBSPL ultrasonic sounds 10 cm
      from tomato and tobacco plants, implying that these sounds could be
      detected by some organisms from up to several meters away. We developed
      machine learning models that were capable of distinguishing between plant
      sounds and general noises, and identifying the condition of the plants –
      dry, cut, or intact – based solely on the emitted sounds. Our results
      suggest that animals, humans, and possibly even other plants, could use
      sounds emitted by a plant to gain information about the plant’s condition.
      More investigation on plant bioacoustics in general and on sound emission
      in plants in particular may open new avenues for understanding plants and
      their interactions with the environment, and it may also have a
      significant impact on agriculture.

    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: Nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures over whole vertebrates
      is needed for a systematic understanding of human diseases, but this has
      not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate whole-ExM, which enables
      nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures of whole zebrafish larvae
      by labeling the proteins of the larvae with fluorophores and expanding
      them four-fold. We first optimize the fluorophore selection and labeling
      procedure to visualize a broader range of anatomical structures. We then
      develop an expansion protocol for zebrafish larvae having calcified body
      parts. Through this process, we visualize the nanoscale details of diverse
      larvae organs, which have corresponding organ counterparts in humans, over
      the intact larvae. We show that whole-ExM retains the fluorescence signals
      of fluorescent proteins, and its resolution is high enough to visualize
      various structures that can be imaged only with electron microscopy.
      Whole-ExM would enable the nanoscale study of the molecular mechanisms of
      human diseases.

    title: A stochastic model for COVID-19 spread and the effects of Alert Level 4
      in Aotearoa New Zealand
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: While case numbers remain low, population-wide control methods
      combined with efficient tracing, testing, and case isolation, offer the
      opportunity for New Zealand to contain and eliminate COVID-19. We use a
      stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for
      COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four
      week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In
      particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation
      operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide
      controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised
      using current case data, although we do not make use of information
      concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not
      stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case
      isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that
      at the early stages of New Zealand's response) can lead to containment or
      elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place.
      Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long
      as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we
      find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will
      most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of
      this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing,
      or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is
      combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for
      longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an
      age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic
      dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional
      containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the
      potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers.

    title: "Efficacy of Sofosbuvir plus Ledipasvir in Egyptian patients with
      COVID-19 compared to standard treatment: Randomized controlled trial"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2,
      which is an RNA virus similar to HCV in the replication process.
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is an approved drug by the FDA to treat HCV
      infection. This study investigates the efficacy of Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir
      as a treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19 infection.. Methods:
      This is a single-blinded parallel-randomized controlled trial. The
      participants were randomized equally into the intervention group received
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (S.L. group), and the control group received
      Oseltamivir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Azithromycin (OCH group). The primary
      outcomes were the cure rate over time and the incidence of serious adverse
      events. The secondary outcomes included the laboratory findings. Results:
      Two hundred and fifty patients were divided equally into each group. Both
      groups were similar regarding gender, but age was higher in the S.L. group
      (p=0.001). In the S.L. group, 89 (71.2%) patients were cured, while only
      51 (40.8%) patients were cured in the OCH group. The cure rate was
      significantly higher in the S.L. group (RR=1.75, p<0.001). Kaplan-Meir
      plot showed a considerably higher cure over time in the S.L. group
      (Log-rank test, p=0.032). There were no deaths in the S.L. group, but
      there were six deaths (4.8%) in the OCH group (RR=0.08, p=0.013). Seven
      patients (5.6%) in the S.L. group and six patients (4.8%) in the OCH group
      were admitted to ICU (RR=1.17, P=0.776). There was no significant
      difference between treatment groups regarding Total Leukocyte Count,
      Neutrophils count, Lymph, Alanine transaminase, and Urea. Conclusion:
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is suggestive of being effective in treating
      patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to
      compare Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with the new treatment protocols."

    title: The plasmablast response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is dominated by
      non-neutralizing antibodies that target both the NTD and the RBD
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: In this study we profiled vaccine-induced polyclonal antibodies as
      well as plasmablast derived mAbs from subjects who received SARS-CoV-2
      spike mRNA vaccine. Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust
      and comparable to or exceeded those seen after natural infection. However,
      that the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was
      greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we
      found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have
      neutralizing activity. We also found a co-dominance of mAbs targeting the
      NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original antigenic-sin like
      backboost to seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins.
      Neutralizing activity of NTD mAbs but not RBD mAbs against a clinical
      viral isolate carrying E484K as well as extensive changes in the NTD was
      abolished, suggesting that a proportion of vaccine induced RBD binding
      antibodies may provide substantial protection against viral variants
      carrying E484K.

    title: Practical Indicators for Risk of Airborne Transmission in Shared Indoor
      Environments and their application to COVID-19 Outbreaks
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Some infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can be transmitted via
      aerosols that are emitted by an infectious person and inhaled by
      susceptible individuals. Although physical distancing effectively reduces
      short-range airborne transmission, many infections have occurred when
      sharing room air despite maintaining distancing. We propose two simple
      parameters as indicators of infection risk for this situation. They
      combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission
      indoors: virus-containing aerosol generation rate, breathing flow rate,
      masking and its quality, ventilation and air cleaning rates, number of
      occupants, and duration of exposure. COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend
      in relation to these parameters that is consistent with an airborne
      infection model, supporting the importance of airborne transmission for
      these outbreaks. The observed trends of outbreak size vs. risk parameters
      allow us to recommend values of the parameters to minimize COVID-19 indoor
      infection risk. All of the pre-pandemic spaces are in a regime where they
      are highly sensitive to mitigation efforts. Measles outbreaks occur at
      much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19, while tuberculosis
      outbreaks are observed at much higher risk parameter values. Since both
      diseases are accepted as airborne, the fact that COVID-19 is less
      contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission. It is
      important that future outbreak reports include ventilation information, to
      allow expanding our knowledge of the circumstances conducive to airborne
      transmission of different diseases."

      I mailed the author for correspondence constructively two weeks ago but I have had no reply. 


      I am a professor of computer science. The Excel spreadsheet is, sadly, appalling and needs a lot of professional work to be believable. There is no useful documentation about how it is intended to work. It is obscure and impossible to check. I doubt it is correct, unless evidence can be provided. In short, the results described in this paper cannot be relied on or used for any public health purposes.


      Have any of the authors carefully reviewed the spreadsheet? Any independent parties? If so I think the paper should say so.


      Best wishes, though, with this important work.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

    abstract: Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging across the globe,
      continuing to threaten the efforts to end COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data
      indicate the prevalence of variants with N440K Spike substitution in
      several parts of India, which is under the second wave of the pandemic.
      Here, we first analyze the prevalence of N440K variants within the
      sequences submitted from India and identify a rising trend of its spread
      across various clusters. We then compare the replicative fitness and
      infectivity of a prototype of this variant with two other previously
      prevalent strains. The N440K variant produced ten times higher infectious
      viral titers than a prevalent A2a strain, and over 1000 folds higher
      titers than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 cells.
      Similar results were detected in Calu-3 cells as well, confirming the
      increased potency of the N440K variant. Interestingly, A3i strain showed
      the highest viral RNA levels, but the lowest infectious titers in the
      culture supernatants, indicating the absence of correlation between the
      RNA content and the infectivity of the sample. N440K mutation has been
      reported in several viral sequences across India and based on our results,
      we predict that the higher infectious titers achieved by this strain could
      possibly lead to its higher rate of transmission. Availability of more
      sequencing data in the immediate future would help understand the
      potential spread of this variant in more detail.

    title: Muscle Van Gogh-like 2 shapes the neuromuscular synapse by regulating
      MuSK signaling activity
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: The development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) requires dynamic
      trans-synaptic coordination orchestrated by secreted factors, including
      the morphogens of the Wnt family. Yet, how the signal of these synaptic
      cues is transduced, and particularly during the regulation of
      acetylcholine receptor (AChR) accumulation in the postsynaptic membrane
      remains unclear. We explored the function of Van Gogh-Like protein 2
      (Vangl2), a core component of Wnt planar cell polarity signaling. We
      showed that the conditional genetic ablation of Vangl2 in muscle
      reproduces the NMJ differentiation defects in mice with constitutive
      Vangl2 deletion. These alterations persisted into adulthood with NMJs
      disassembly leading to an impairment of neurotransmission and motor
      function deficits. Mechanistically, we found that Vangl2 and the
      muscle-specific kinase MuSK acted in the same genetic pathway and that
      Vangl2 binds MuSK, thus controlling its signaling activity. Our results
      identify Vangl2 as a key player of the core complex of molecules shaping
      neuromuscular synapses and shed light on the molecular mechanisms
      underlying NMJ assembly.

      Recently, my biomedical research seminar had the opportunity to read and
      discuss your paper. Detailed below are some of the comments we had on your
      work. 


      Strengths: We appreciated your figures also diagrammed your methods – for example, Figure 1A made it extremely clear what you were knocking out and how you were doing so. We also really appreciated that your figures were not all graphs/quantitative data, but also the IHC stains that were eventually used for data analysis (i.e. Figures 1D, 2C, 3A, 6C, 7A). 


      Weaknesses/Suggestions: While we did appreciate the IHC images, the quantitative graphs were too small and need to be enlarged to allow for easier data analysis. Additionally, certain figures were redundant – for example, both 4A and 4B show absolute force; similarly, both 4E and 4D show stimulation frequency and CMAP amplitude. Such redundancies convoluted the conversation, as students were confused what new information (if any) they were being presented with. Finally, the images need to be made more accessible to all readers – consider using magenta/blue stains to make data readable to colorblind readers, and include arrows in IHC stains so readers know what they are looking for. 


      Overall, we really appreciated your scientific writing and the significance of your work – finding the mechanism by which Vangl2 interacts with MuSK to affect neuromuscular activity. We believe that with these small revisions, you can improve your data presentation and make the science more accessible to the readers.

    title: Principles of gene regulation quantitatively connect DNA to RNA and
      proteins in bacteria
    category: systems-biology
    abstract: "Bacteria allocate their proteome to cellular functions differently in
      different growth conditions. It is largely unknown how such allocation
      arises from known mechanisms of gene regulation while constrained by
      limited translation capacity and fixed protein density. Here, we performed
      absolute transcriptomic and proteomic analysis for E. coli across many
      conditions, obtaining a plethora of results on promoters and mRNAs
      characteristics that clash with conventional expectations: the majority of
      mRNAs exhibit similar translational efficiencies, while the promoter
      strengths are vastly different across genes. These characteristics
      prescribe two principles of gene regulation guiding bacteria to attain the
      desired protein allocation under global constraints: Total transcriptional
      output is tightly coordinated with ribosomal activity, and the
      concentrations of individual proteins are largely set by transcription.
      These two principles lead to a quantitative formulation of Central Dogma
      which unravels the complex relationship between gene regulatory activities
      and mRNA/protein concentrations across conditions. The knowledge obtained
      will be invaluable for accurately inferring gene regulatory interactions

      Readers note: The authors make the following assumptions in all their
      analysis, which critically undermines several of their most important (and
      controversial) conclusions:


      1.   The authors are treating their ribosome profiling experiments as a measurement of translation rate. That's incorrect. Ribosome profiling measures the relative density of ribosomes bound to mRNAs. It is not a direct measurement of translation rate nor is it a direct measurement of translational efficiency.  


      Let me be clear with these terms: Translation rate is the number of proteins produced per mRNA per time. Translational efficiency is the number of proteins produced by a single transcript before it is degraded. Ribosome density is the translation initiation rate divided by the mRNA's translation elongation rate. 


      2.  The authors assume that all mRNAs have the same translation elongation rate in order to convert ribosome densities into translation rates. For example, in their Equation 5, epsilon (translation elongation rate) is just a single constant, used throughout to relate translation rates to protein synthesis rates and protein concentrations. This is incorrect. mRNAs do not all have the same translation elongation rate. There is a whole genre of literature on synonymous codon usage, the effects of synonymous codons on ribosome translocation speeds, and the use of codon optimization to increase heterologous protein expression levels. Epsilon is not a single constant. At the very least, if we only care about protein concentrations, one must consider the CDS-averaged translation elongation rate for each mRNA transcript in the transcriptome. 


      The authors' conclusion "Translation initiation rates are similar across mRNAs and growth conditions" needs to be revisited without assuming that all translation elongation rates are the same. Likewise, the conclusion that "Total mRNA abundance matches the translational capacity" depends on the veracity of this conclusion. The conclusion that "Constancy of ribosome spacing across mRNA and nutrient conditions" is more accurately viewed as "Constancy of *ribosome density* across mRNA and nutrient conditions".  Finally, the conclusion that "Total mRNA synthesis flux is adjusted to match translational capacity" is again dependent on the veracity of the first conclusion. 


      Concluding that all mRNAs have the same translation rate is bold. But it's not supported by data. If you see someone using ribosome profiling to make this claim, be skeptical!

    title: Pronounced genetic separation among varieties of the Primula cusickiana
      species complex, a Great Basin endemic
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Distinguishing between unique species and populations with strong
      genetic structure is a common challenge in population genetics, especially
      in fragmented habitats where allopatric speciation may be widespread and
      distinct groups may be morphologically similar. Such is often the case
      with species complexes across sky island environments. In these scenarios,
      biogeography may help to explain the relations between species complex
      members, and RADseq methods are commonly used to compare closely related
      species across thousands of genetic loci. Here we use RADseq to clarify
      the relations between geographically distinct but morphologically similar
      varieties of the Primula cusickiana species complex, and to contextualize
      past findings of strong genetic structure among populations within
      varieties. Our genomic analyses demonstrate pronounced separation between
      isolated populations of this Great Basin endemic, indicating that the
      current varietal classification of complex members is inaccurate and
      emphasizing their conservation importance. We discuss how these results
      correspond to recent biogeographical models used to describe the
      distribution of other sky island taxa in western North America. Our
      findings also fit into a wider trend observed for alpine Primula species
      complexes, and we consider how heterostylous breeding systems may be
      contributing to frequent diversification via allopatric speciation in this
      genus.

      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample

      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low

      They reversed the numbers for the Niaee study which was pivotal to their conclusion. See <a href="https://twitter.com/Covid19Crusher/status/1397214174766325765">this tweet from CovidAnalysis</a> for details on the switch. There is also a video from Niaee himself attesting to the fact ivermectin works. 


      When you use the correct data, it shows ivermectin works. No surprise.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and

      "...a yet-proven truth, that all the wearing of masks was futile..."

      Man, you are waaaay behind on real evidence. There's plenty of real research and data to show that no type of mask stops the SARS-CoV-2 virus and make no difference in COVID-19 infections, because the virus spreads through aerosol. 


      If you just wanna look at one place to see the list of evidence then look here: 

      1. https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/

      2. Or perhaps this section as well:

    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

      You have wrong data in the mortality analysis for Niaee study. You swaped
      IVM for Control. According to the study, 4 deaths from 116 occured in IVM
      and 11/49 occured in Control.


      Looking forward to your recalculation.

    raw_message: Keep looking, Norbert-man. Seems you cherry pick, which is what I
      suspect these researchers of doing too. That's politics, not science.
      Aerosol can get through, which means the effectiveness is not 100%. Unless
      there is  smart steering on board the tiny particles, or the mask material
      actually repels them, the mask will stop some. (It would be interesint for
      someone to find a smart mask material that draws the aerosol.) Note too,
      how vapor saturation of masks from the wearer's breath increases mask
      effectiveness. This is out there as well.

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

      The results and conclusions of this study are wrong.  The authors mistook
      the ivermectin and control arms of one of the RCTs that they
      included.  Look at figure 2.  The results from Niaee 2020 are dramatically
      misreported.  The actual results for that study are as follows:


      Control groups: 11 deaths out of 60 patients.

      Ivermectin groups: 4 deaths out of 90 patients.


      When this is corrected, the results of this meta-analysis confirm what other meta-analyses have found.  Ivermectin use is associated with approximately 66% reduction in Covid fatalities.  And this result is statistically significant.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted

      From your first link (1) - point (4) is misinformation and discredits the
      entire article and thus the site.


      The technical report in point is https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf, which states:


      "The evidence regarding the effectiveness of medical face masks for the prevention of COVID-19 in the community is compatible with a small to moderate protective effect, but there are still significant uncertainties about the size of this effect.", and


      "Although the evidence for the use of medical face masks in the community to prevent COVID-19 is limited, face masks should be considered as a non-pharmaceutical intervention in combination with other measures as part of efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic."


      I'm not even going to bother going over the other cherry-picked/misrepresented studies/reports.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles

      A further point needs to be made, before we throw away our masks -- that
      masks do not help the individual wearer. This research barely touches on
      that, thus is open to be used politically to cause virus spread.  And if
      an individual thought that this research showed that a mask does not help
      the wearer, it could cause many to shed their masks when it would be
      dangerous. 


      Here in my city, we just dropped off the "high risk" or "red" category last week, which means too many spreaders were walking around town, many willy nilly. Should I still be wearing a mask, can it stop the virus from getting to me? This study does not answer that question. If masks help as many studies shown or at least indicated, then public health officials need help now in getting the message out.


      Let's backtrack and attempt the assumptive leap for a moment and try to affirm that this study points to a yet-proven truth, that all the wearing of masks was futile, because of the ineffectiveness of the mask only, which even causes problems for wearers. Let's try to affirm that with a thought experiment. Imagine with me that what got invented is the dream 100% mask back in April 2020, that (1) when worn, causes no discomfort or infection in the wearer and (2) completely prevents any wearer from being able to catch the covid virus. What if any difference would this have made to the results of this study? The hypotheses this leads to have to do with how human behavior and politics help viruses spread -- even in the face of mask-wearing. 


      For instance, consider the work of Ngaire Woods, founding dean of the Blavatnik School of Government and professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford. In his article, "What factors have determined how well countries have done in responding to the pandemic?," Richard Smith, a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, writes that "Woods identified three factors that had a strong influence on how well countries did," and, "The single most important factor, she argued, was effective collaboration between national and subnational governments." 


      Could this be translated for our purposes here, to be that there was little "subversion" by the populace too, that more successful countries had fewer parties or funerals where masks were shed, events which I witnessed and attended. It only takes one bullet to hit a target, so catch the target when the mask is off or down under the nose. In other words, if you were a virus, how would you enlist "subversive grandmother soldiers," say, to unmask around their grandchildren, allowing a snaking trail of the virus to spread from household to household. How many people broke their social bubbles?

      This study reinforces an earlier Danish one published in the <i>Annals of
      Internal Medicine</i> which found that the result of mask wearing had so
      little statistical significance it could be "compatible with a 46%
      reduction to a 23% increase in infection."


      <blockquote>Results:

      A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.

      Well, it’s not whether there is a mandate in place, is it?

      <b>It’s whether the mandate is adhered to.

      And when people actually comply, and wear the masks, Covid spread declines.</b>

      <code>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249891</code>


      Funny how a disease spread primarily through droplet spread can be halted by methods that stop droplet spread, isn’t it?

      ...Who would have thought it?

    raw_message: It is not possible for masks to work. The virus size is akin to
      that of smoke of vaporizer particles. Cloth masks can't filter that sized
      particle. This has been know for years. Masks, like an N-95, must be
      fitted to be at all effective. Otherwise, you create strong side vent
      outgasings that just disperse the exhaled breath around the mask.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

            A large randomized community-based trial in which 4862 healthy
              participants were divided into a group wearing medical/surgical
              masks and a control group found no difference in infection with
              SARS-CoV-2. A recent systematic review found nine trials (of
              which eight were cluster-randomized controlled trials in which
              clusters of people, versus individuals, were randomized)
              comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks to prevent the
              spread of viral respiratory illness. Two trials were with
              healthcare workers and seven in the community. The review
              concluded that wearing a mask may make little or no difference
              to the prevention of influenza-like illness.https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak

      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with

      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19

      I would like to read about that if you can provide a link. It makes more sense to me that as your mask gets coated with spit, it begins to act as a mesh nebulizer to convert the previously harmless big drops into aerosol droplets every time you exhale through the mask's tiny pores. Those can float around for hours and be inhaled by other people. In other words, if you are infected, putting on a mask turns you into a walking covid mosquito fogger.

      If masks worked as well as the faithful claim they do, we would see overwhelming correlation between mask use and reduced cases, deaths and hospitalizations. We don't. <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmsc">Ian Miller</a> tweets the non-proof every day.

      And what you're continuing is cherrypicking fear mongering - not
      science.  With word salad cherrypicking, hoping to get away with calling
      it "science".



      Jan 2021 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

            According to the current knowledge, the virus SARS-CoV-2 has a
              diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm [nanometers (billionth of a meter)],
              while medical and non-medical facemasks’ thread diameter ranges
              from 55 µm to 440 µm [micrometers (one millionth of a meter),
              which is more than 1000 times larger.  Due to the difference in
              sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter,
              SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask.

            

            A meta-analysis among health care workers
              found that compared to no masks, surgical mask and N95
              respirators were not effective against transmission of viral
              infections or influenza-like illness based on six RCTs. Using
              separate analysis of 23 observational studies, this meta-analysis
              found no protective effect of medical mask or N95 respirators
              against SARS virus. A recent systematic review of 39 studies
              including 33,867 participants in community settings (self-report
              illness), found no difference between N95 respirators versus
              surgical masks and surgical mask versus no masks in the risk for
              developing influenza or influenza-like illness, suggesting their
              ineffectiveness of blocking viral transmissions in community
              settings.

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.

      Yet another huge double mistake :

      In Fig.6 (viral clearance) for Karamat study, the number of events are WRONG, and they're represented on the WRONG SIDE. 

      Karamat counts nb of viral clearance at day 3 (17 IVM vs 2 control), then the *additional* number at day 7 (20 more in IVM group vs 18 more in control group). Fig.6 only counts the additional count between day 3 and day 7, and forgets what happened till day 3. 

      Hence the figures in Fig.6 for Karamat should be either "17 for Ivermectin and 2 for Control" or "37 for Ivermectin and 20 for Control". 

      And these figures are IN FAVOR of ivermectin. Even the wrong "20" and "18" should have been represented on the "favors IVM " side.

    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use

      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and

      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay

      Other mistakes seem to weigh on the results and on the conclusions.
      Examples :

      In Figure 3, how could the mean length of stay in Niaee's control group be smaller than the one in ivermectin group, when Niaee finds a significant reduction of stay with IVM ?

      In Figure 2 (Mortality), how can RR for Chaccour be 1 when there's no event ? (Shouldn't it be "not calculatable" ?)

      In Figure 5, (severe adverse events), one is included despite Krolewiecki mentions the one reported "has not been reported in association to IVM"

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      A legitimate question.  Will you take it at face value after it has been
      peer reviewed?

      I've been looking into the science behind mask mandates for a while now and there is literally NOT ONE RCT study which has found masks (or respirators for that matter) to be effective to reduce the transmission of viral illness.  Other things like droplets, sure, but not viral illness.

      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse

      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.

      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to

      When the data for Niaee study was corrected for version 2 the weights
      given to the studies were also changed. The weights in figure 2 changed in
      a way that is hard to explain by the Niaee data fix alone.


      Was any other parameter adjusted for version 2 than data for Niaee study? If so, on what basis was the other parameters changed?

      Seeing people going back and forth here, but I'll just point this out:


      If wearing masks are really that effective, as some claim, how are medical staff getting infected <i>on the job</i> despite the extra medical gear, protection, and protocols? The overwhelming majority of you can only provide conjecture <i>at best.</i> If medical staff adhering to strict sanitation protocols still get infected by a respiratory illness </I>on site,</I> what makes anyone believe that less effective equipment, or less physical coverage provided by said equipment, would be effective for a general population less equipped to adhere to stricter sanitation protocols?

      Seriously, it’s like some researchers opposed to the concept of EARLY
      treatment of COVID will go to any lengths to provide evidence against it,
      even if it crosses the line of scientific ethics.


      Sorry, to have to say this but the authors no longer have any credibility on this issue.

       Extremely important to recognize the importance of this: to provide evidence against IVM researchers have had to change data to fit their conclusion.

       What does that tell you about the effectiveness of IVM?

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    raw_message: If you follow real science (of which there is a great deal on this
      subject). There has never been any that can show any advantage of mask
      wearing for a viral issue. Theories on water droplet dispersion rates,
      etc., abound. But the hard evidence clearly and repeatedly shows that the
      spread of any virus is not affected in the least by wearing a mask. It's
      like trying to keep flies out with a chain link fence.

    raw_message: It’s astonishing that anyone thinks that this study is in any way
      scientific, controlled, with conclusions based on anything but bias. It’s
      alarming that such nonsense writings like these are even taken seriously
      enough for someone to decide to publish it, spread it around the internet.
      The times of truth, fact and reality ruling the day, are behind us. They
      are destroying science and destroying our democracy. That is very sad

    raw_message: I find it interesting that those states that implemented early mask
      mandates have slightly high death rates than states that never implemented
      masking.  In addition, when new case rates were at the highest we also had
      >93% mask compliance in those states that required masks.  The real world
      data seems to refute your position.

    raw_message: You obviously don't grasp what they are saying.  Mandates
      absolutely increased the amount of people wearing masks.  Even though
      those mandates were in place, the data shows that it did not slow the
      spread of Covid during times of Covid surges.  Ergo, the mandate and
      wearing masks do decrease the rate of transmission.

    abstract: Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants recently identified in India
      designated B.1.617 and B.1.618 have mutations within the spike protein
      that may contribute to their increased transmissibility and that could
      potentially result in re-infection or resistance to vaccine-elicited
      antibody. B.1.617 encodes a spike protein with mutations L452R, E484Q,
      D614G and P681R while the B.1.618 spike has mutations {Delta}145-146,
      E484K and D614G. We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant
      proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent
      sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.
      Viruses with B.1.617 and B.1.618 spike were neutralized with a 2-5-fold
      decrease in titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies.
      The E484Q and E484K versions were neutralized with a 2-4-fold decrease in
      titer. Virus with the B.1.617 spike protein was neutralized with a
      4.7-fold decrease in titer by the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail
      as a result of the L452R mutation. The modest neutralization resistance of
      the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that
      current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618
      variants.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing

      I'm skeptical of both studies. The one you linked to has a small sample
      size, and I don't like that it reported a coefficient (140 cases/100,000),
      which is small, and doesn't note that there were wide overlapping
      confidence intervals in its conclusions. Really wide. Did you check the
      chart? 


      This study on this page seems anti-mask agenda-driven, and its conclusions in the summary are over-generalized. There probably is not a statistically significant difference between mask-mandate states and non-mask mandate states, but that doesn't mean masks never work. 


      A mandate to wear a mask walking down a city street is not the same as a mandate to wear one when visiting someone in a hospital or a brief visit in some other close-up situation. But both studies tend to treat these as roughly the same. 


      There's clearly a lot more research needed on this. Most of the studies done in 2020 are junk, proven inaccurate by the historical data.

      The study states the mandate didn’t slow spread.

      But we know that the mandate is irrelevant, it’s whether it is properly adhered to and whether people are compliant with a range of measures that is important.

      Well, your argument would just verify my point...it’s the wearing of masks
      that cuts Covid transmission, not whether there is some advice in place to
      do so.

      But of course one needs to wear them properly, or they may not work. 


      An suitable analogy might be as follows:

      “Installation of clean water and sewage facilities does not cut dysentery risk”

      If one finds that a significant number of the population are refusing to practice basic hygiene and are still defecating in the wells used for drinking, do you think the study conclusion should be “Public health interventions do not stop the spread of dysentery”, and for governments to cease to provide tap water and toilets for their citizens?


      PS: The reuse of surgical masks depends upon their contamination. They are used for 4-6 hours continuously in hospital settings. It’s advised that you wear a new mask if as a member of the public you are taking one off and then need to remask. There is an elements of common sense here... if I am going into say Tesco’s for a few minutes, then into Boots 5 minutes later, I might for the sake of convenience just put on the mask again, assuming I have kept it clean in the interim. I notice some people “wearing their mask” in open air spaces in towns, usually because they are going from one shop to the next a few doors down. Taking the mask off between those times seems more trouble than it’s worth, so they leave it on. This week I was dropping in at the petrol station attached to my local Tesco superstore, so I didn’t bother to take off my mask, drove 300 yds in the car while wearing my mask, then got petrol. No big deal. I didn’t die from hypoxia, but no doubt some antimasker laughed when they saw me wearing the mask in the car.

      Just use your common sense, I say. There’s not much of that about these days.

      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

    title: The IL-10GFP (VeRT-X) mouse strain is not suitable for the detection of
      IL-10 production by granulocytes during lung inflammation
    category: immunology
    abstract: The clear and unequivocal identification of immune effector functions
      is essential to understand immune responses. The cytokine IL-10 is a
      critical immune regulator and was shown, for example, to limit pathology
      during various lung diseases. However, the clear identification of
      IL-10-producing cells is challenging and, therefore, reporter mouse lines
      were developed to facilitate their detection. Several such reporter lines
      utilize GFP, including the IL-10 GFP (VeRT-X) reporter strain studied
      here. In line with previous reports, we found that this IL-10 GFP line
      faithfully reports on the IL-10 production of lymphoid cells. However, we
      show that the IL-10 GFP reporter is not suitable to analyse IL-10
      production of myeloid cells during inflammations. During inflammation, the
      autofluorescence of myeloid cells increased to an extent that entirely
      masked the IL-10-specific GFP-signal. Our data illustrate a general and
      important technical caveat using GFP-reporter lines for the analysis of
      myeloid cells and suggest that previous reports on effector functions of
      myeloid cells using such GFP-based reporters might require re-evaluation.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    abstract: Proper cell fate determination is largely orchestrated by complex gene
      regulatory networks centered around transcription factors. However,
      experimental elucidation of key transcription factors that drive cellular
      identity is currently often intractable. Here, we present ANANSE (ANalysis
      Algorithm for Networks Specified by Enhancers), a network-based method
      that exploits enhancerencoded regulatory information to identify the key
      transcription factors in cell fate determination. As cell type-specific
      transcription factors predominantly bind to enhancers, we use regulatory
      networks based on enhancer properties to prioritize transcription factors.
      First, we predict genome-wide binding profiles of transcription factors in
      various cell types using enhancer activity and transcription factor
      binding motifs. Subsequently, applying these inferred binding profiles, we
      construct cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, and then predict
      key transcription factors controlling cell fate conversions using
      differential gene networks between cell types. This method outperforms
      existing approaches in correctly predicting major transcription factors
      previously identified to be sufficient for trans-differentiation. Finally,
      we apply ANANSE to define an atlas of key transcription factors in 18
      normal human tissues. In conclusion, we present a ready-to-implement
      computational tool for efficient prediction of transcription factors in
      cell fate determination and to study transcription factor-mediated
      regulatory mechanisms. ANANSE is freely available at
      https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/ANANSE.

    raw_message: The burden of proof is on the entity wanting to enforce mask
      mandates that mask mandates actually work. There is no burden to prove
      that masks don't work. This study (and many others) set out to determine
      if mask mandates work (reduce transmission rates) and was not able to
      establish any correlation between mandates and reduced transmission rates.
      Hence, the burden of proof is still on the maskers to prove that masks
      work - not on anti-maskers to prove they don't.

      both the data on deaths and the data on the number of individuals infected
      are subject to many different biases. We consider a Bayesian evidence
      synthesis approach which, while simple enough for researchers to
      understand and use, accounts for many important sources of uncertainty
      inherent in both the seroprevalence and mortality data. We estimate the
      COVID-19 IFR to be 0.40% (95% credible interval of (0.20%, 0.63%)) for a
      typical population where the proportion of those aged over 65 years old is
      9% and where the GDP (at purchasing-power parity (ppp)) per capita is
      $17.8K (the approximate worldwide values). Our results suggest that, as
      one might expect, lower IFRs are associated with younger and with
      wealthier populations.

    title: "scTenifoldKnk: a machine learning workflow performing virtual knockout
      experiments on single-cell gene regulatory networks"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Gene knockout (KO) experiments are a proven approach for studying gene
      function. A typical KO experiment usually involves the phenotypic
      characterization of KO organisms. The recent advent of single-cell
      technology has greatly boosted the resolution of cellular phenotyping,
      providing unprecedented insights into cell-type-specific gene function.
      However, the use of single-cell technology in large-scale, systematic KO
      experiments is prohibitive due to the vast resources required. Here we
      present scTenifoldKnk, a machine learning workflow that performs virtual
      KO experiments using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
      scTenifoldKnk first uses data from wild-type (WT) samples to construct a
      single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN). Then, a gene is knocked out
      from the constructed scGRN by setting weights of the gene's outward edges
      to zeros. ScTenifoldKnk then compares this "pseudo-KO" scGRN with the
      original scGRN to identify differentially regulated (DR) genes. These DR
      genes, also called virtual-KO perturbed genes, are used to assess the
      impact of the gene KO and reveal the gene's function in analyzed cells.
      Using existing data sets, we demonstrate that the scTenifoldKnk analysis
      recapitulates the main findings of three real-animal KO experiments and
      confirms the functions of genes underlying three Mendelian diseases. We
      show the power of scTenifoldKnk as a predictive method to successfully
      predict the outcomes of two KO experiments that involve intestinal
      enterocytes in Ahr-/- mice and pancreatic islet cells in Malat1-/- mice,
      respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scTenifoldKnk to perform
      systematic KO analyses, in which a large number of genes are virtually
      deleted, allowing gene functions to be revealed in a cell type-specific
      manner.

      Dear Samuel,


      Thank you very much for your interest in our work, as well as for your thorough review and comments. We will try our best to solve your questions below:


      1.	We agree with your point of view about the effect of a gene knockout on cellular homeostasis. In fact, in metabolic models where this kind of analysis is usually done using optimization approaches, the propagation effect of the gene knockout across several parts of the metabolism is evident. Nevertheless, Santolini and Barabasi (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1720589115) compared the performance of the topology to predict the perturbation patterns caused by a gene knockout against the result of the optimization methods. They found a good overlap in the prediction, and based on those findings; we decided to use the topological approach. We did not try multi-knockout experiments since, as you mention single-cell RNA-seq characterization for those experiments is not yet available. However, we did try a double knockout and found a good overlap with the findings reported by the paper describing the dataset (Figure 3, Panel C). We yet do not have any other evidence to support or reject your hypothesis about the decrease of the precision of the predictions with an increasing number of knocked-out genes at the same time. 


      2.	Since the regulatory link between two genes is assessed using principal components regression (PCR), the result after evaluating all the associations is a fully connected asymmetric weighted network. You may consider PCR as a partial correlation analysis (pcorr). When C1 and C2 are the same, pcorr(A,B|C1) equals pcorr(B,A|C2). However, in PCR, C1 is not equal to C2—C1 is all genes excluding B, while C2 is all genes excluding A. This asymmetry makes the result of PCR an asymmetric matrix. To further set the directionality of the resultant matrix, first, we removed the weaker link between two genes, and then, we filtered the links below the 95th percentile to reduce the false-positive rate. We provided evidence supporting that the true directionality of the regulation is favored by the regression method with a larger weight value (Figure S1, Panel C) when the directionality is tested using the transcription factors and their target genes reported by the ENCODE database. We also provided evidence of the accuracy of principal components regression to detect the association between genes in single-cell RNA-seq without imputation compared with other methods during the benchmark of scTenifoldNet (Figure 2, Panel A in DOI:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100139).


      3.	We are afraid we have to disagree with you on this. We did our best to perform an unbiased comparison of the gene knockout phenotypic effect reported by the authors of the datasets and the results provided by scTenifoldKnk. In fact, the characterizations made for the authors are not only based on data-driven approaches using the generated single-cell RNA-seq datasets but also include other experimental techniques. We used several gene-set databases to evaluate the extent of the overlap that we can predict, as it is recognized that a single gene or pathway often cannot fully explain a particular cellular state. Instead, biological processes are better characterized by gene regulatory networks, whose structures are altered as the phenotype changes (DOI: 10.1038/s41540-018-0052-5). We thought about reporting the result of scTenifoldNet and compare them with the results predicted by scTenifoldKnk. Still, since we are the developers of both methods, we decided to better compare our findings with the results reported by the original authors of the datasets. Please note that the original authors did not report all the changes or perturbed gene sets found after the gene knockout. We believe your experimental design is correct and feasible. However, also have in mind that not all the regulatory changes induced by a gene are detectable as changes in the expression level since a given gene may be under the regulation of more of one gene at the same time.


      4.	To evaluate the stability and robustness of the results provided by scTenifoldKnk, we used two approaches. First, we compared the results obtained by running independently scTenifoldKnk over two biological replicates in the Mecp2 example (Figure S2, Panel D) and found that the overlapping results agree with what is known about the Rett Syndrome pathology that is caused by the malfunctioning of the Mecp2 gene. Second, we resampled the cells used as input for scTenifoldKnk 10 times and compared the rank of the perturbed genes in the predicted in-silico knockout for each one of them. Since single-cell RNA-seq allows to uncover hidden subpopulations of cells with specialized phenotypes, and for that reason, by random subsampling the cells, we expect each of the constructed gene regulatory networks to be unique and provide a unique result. Because the approach is the same and the expected biological effect is the same (randomly sampling cells), we only performed the analysis over the Trem2 dataset. We expect the results to be similar in the other datasets.  


      Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns,


      Best wishes,


      Daniel and James

    title: Balanced mitochondrial and cytosolic translatomes underlie the biogenesis
      of human respiratory complexes
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes consist of nuclear and
      mitochondrial DNA- encoded subunits. Their biogenesis requires
      cross-compartment gene regulation to mitigate the accumulation of
      disproportionate subunits. To determine how human cells coordinate
      mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression processes, we established an
      optimized ribosome profiling approach tailored for the unique features of
      the human mitoribosome. Analysis of ribosome footprints in five cell types
      revealed that average mitochondrial synthesis rates corresponded precisely
      to cytosolic rates across OXPHOS complexes. Balanced mitochondrial and
      cytosolic synthesis did not rely on rapid feedback between the two
      translation systems. Rather, LRPPRC, a gene associated with Leigh's
      syndrome, is required for the reciprocal translatomes and maintains
      cellular proteostasis. Based on our findings, we propose that human
      mitonuclear balance is enabled by matching OXPHOS subunit synthesis rates
      across cellular compartments, which may represent a vulnerability for
      cellular proteostasis.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      This is not good information, and the research is not well done. 


      They used a two-tailed t test with Holm Sidak correction, as if that is suffient to compensate for the complex interplay of factors that produce the same result (infection/non infection). Hell, they even made a simple linear regression to add insult to injury. 


      Essentially, to explain it more simply, using those tests rests on the assumption that there are 2 categories that correlate to other to categories perfectly- mask/not mask and infected/not infected. 


      This is not the case. Masks wearers that social distance will have lesses infection rates than mask wearers who do not. Ventialtion of enclosed areas is also an issue. 


      These "researchers" did not account for the confounding variables that affect infection rates- everything from other measures to testing rate differences among states. 


      Overall, there are many flaws with this research. Not good.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      I think you do have a couple fair points and I myself am a bit critical of
      the paper and agree that concluding masks wearing is not helpful is rash
      on this paper alone. However, Some of the factors that you mention should
      be held constant are, practically, infeasible in my opinion. How do you
      measure amount of enforcement objectively and their effect on mask
      wearing?

      Mask use potentially causing breaches of social distancing, while maybe true, are out of scope of the paper. Even under the assumption that that's true, that event would technically be encouraged under mandated states due to increased mask wearing and I think is fair to say is an unintended effect of mask wearing mandates.


      More research definitely does need to be done on this because, as you point out, a lot of factors could be compounding to mitigate any effectiveness mandates by themselves would bring but discrediting the paper because they do not explore all possible factors is not helpful either. If all papers were to explore all possible factors every time, publications would be few and far between.

    category: microbiology
    first_posted: 2021-05-28
    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains a suboptimal furin
      cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction with the sequence 681PRRAR/S686. This
      cleavage site is required for efficient airway replication, transmission,
      and pathogenicity of the virus. The B.1.617 lineage has recently emerged
      in India, coinciding with substantial disease burden across the country.
      Early evidence suggests that B.1.617.2 (a sublineage of B.1.617) is more
      highly transmissible than contemporary lineages. B.1.617 and its
      sublineages contain a constellation of S mutations including the
      substitution P681R predicted to further optimise this furin cleavage site.
      In this short report we provide experimental evidence that virus of the
      B.1.617 lineage has enhanced S cleavage, that enhanced processing of an
      expressed B.1.617 S protein in cells is due to P681R, and that this
      mutation enables more efficient cleavage of a peptide mimetic of the
      B.1.617 S1/S2 cleavage site by recombinant furin. Together, these data
      demonstrate viruses in this emerging lineage have enhanced S cleavage by
      furin which we hypothesise could be enhancing transmissibility and
      pathogenicity.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      The idea of looking at patients who had at least a substantial cumulated
      dose is great, but there is an important immortal time bias, since the
      patients can't die the first 10 days in the HCQ group, as seen on the
      Kaplan-Meïer


      I suggest to calculate again the results with excluding the first 10 days death in the control group.


      Due to the small group size, you will probably loose significance, but it still will be usefull for pooled analysis.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

      The article is interesting. A few questions to the authors. Did you
      pre-specify the definition of negative PCR?

      Did you compare changes in viral loads from the baseline? Since the median viral load was higher in the placebo arm, this might have affected the likelihood of viral clearance at day 6 and it should be accounted for.

      This research is problematic. 

      First, this clinical trial's primary outcome measures were as attached below. And authors did not mention 2 out of 3 primary outcome measures. These are not good omissions apparently. 


      Second even the primary outcome measure they used was not specified before the study. Authors used ct cut value of 30, which was arbitrary. Authors explain why they did not use 40, but they must have used 40 if that leads to the good results. And that is not a clinical trial. 


      They did not correct for multiple comparisons across three primary endpoints, either, which they should have done as there are three primary endpoints. 




      Second as the figure 2 and the table shows the ct values of two groups before the intervention are close to statistically significant differences (p = 0.10).

      And as the figure 2 shows this group difference did not show even a hint of change at day 6! The two groups were almost statistically different from the beginning and that did not change visually at day 6 apparently. I can't see any hints of effects of IVM from this study. 




      Lay persons are watching this study, and they say they love IVM and hate vaccine and let's use IVM instead of vaccine based on this study's result. We hope authors do the proper research. They should provide three primary endpoints, correct the preexisting differences, and correct multiple comparisons, and should provide apparent conclusions. 






      Primary Outcome Measures  :
            


      Viral clearance at day 6 [ Time Frame: Outcome will be determined till 6 days post intervention ]



      The primary outcome will be the viral clearance at day 6 in the intervention group compared to placebo.


                  	


      Viral shedding duration [ Time Frame: Outcome will be determined till 14 days post intervention ]



      Secondary outcomes: viral shedding duration (time between first positive PCR to last of two consecutive negative tests)


                  	


      Symptoms clearance time [ Time Frame: Outcome will be determined till 14 days post intervention ]



      Time between drug treatment and symptoms resolution

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      That is not a good point. 


      Medical personel are more exposed to the virus than the general population. Errors in use of protective equipment will produce greater infections than the equivalent errors in the general population. 


      Also, the use of masks as source control (controlling the spread instead of just preventing infection) has been demonstrated as effective thorlugh research and practice for more than a 100 years.

    abstract: We analyzed data from two ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological
      surveys in Orange County, CA., between April 2020 and March 2021. A total
      of 8,476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after an
      aggressive mRNA vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a
      multiplex antigen microarray containing 10 SARS-CoV-2 antigens, 4 SARS, 3
      MERS, 12 Common CoV, and 8 Influenza antigens. Twenty-six percent of 3,347
      specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were
      SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The Ab response was predominantly against
      nucleocapsid (NP), full length spike and the spike S2 domain.
      Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and there was no
      cross-reactivity against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. An aggressive mRNA
      vaccination campaign at the UCI Medical Center started on December 16,
      2020 and 6,724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks.
      Seroprevalence increased from 13% in December to 79% in January, 93% in
      February and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced much higher Ab levels
      especially against the RBD domain and significant cross-reactivity against
      SARS RBD and S1 was also observed. Nucleocapsid protein Abs can be used to
      distinguish individuals in a population of vaccinees to classify those who
      have been previously infected and those who have not, because nucleocapsid
      is not in the vaccine. Previously infected individuals developed higher Ab
      titers to the vaccine than those who have not been previously exposed.
      These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much
      stronger and broader Ab response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      I've only attempted to fact check your second source, the Denmark one, and
      your quotes really show your bias here. I could not find the first one cuz
      your reference kinda sucks. I attempted to ctrl f both quotes, and the
      first one "The researchers found no statistically significant difference
      between mask wearers and bare-faced participants." does not exist. 


      The second one while partially true, is cut off from what is actually said. The real quote is:


      "The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection". 


      Note here where they specify the limitations of their study. Their conclusion is less general than, "does not reduce infection rate", but rather that when everyone else does not where masks, mask wearing does not appear to help. Their study, if you did actually read it, is only relevant to the specific scenario in the quote and by the authors notes while responding to comments “the findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”


      If you are going to cite papers, please read them instead of skimming for anything that you believe.

    title: COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is not detected in human milk
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: Several countries have recently approved the use of mRNA vaccines
      against COVID-19 under an emergency use authorization. However, no
      pregnant or lactating individuals were included in the Phase 3 clinical
      trials of these vaccines despite belonging to a group at high risk for
      severe complications of COVID-19 infection. We show here that the mRNA
      from anti-COVID vaccines is not detected in human breast milk samples
      collected 4-48 hours post-vaccine. These results strengthen the
      recommendation of ABM and WHO that lactating individuals who receive the
      anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine should continue to breastfeed their
      infants uninterrupted.

      Nice, but irrelevant. The worry has been that the mRNA encoded <i><b>spike protein</b></i> gets into breast milk (and other tissues). 




      There does not appear to be any concern that the mRNA itself appears in breast milk. So the paper of Golan, et al., is irrelevant to the concern.

    title: Interim estimates of increased transmissibility, growth rate, and
      reproduction number of the Covid-19 B.1.617.2 variant of concern in the
      United Kingdom
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: This paper relates to data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK,
      regarding Covid-19 genomic surveillance. We use a simple model to give
      point estimates of the effective reproduction numbers of the B.1.617.2 and
      B.1.1.7 lineages in England, from sequenced data as at 15 May 2021.
      Comparison with the estimated reproduction number of B.1.1.7 enables an
      estimate of the increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2. We conclude that
      it is almost certain that there is increased transmissibility that will
      rapidly lead to B.1.617.2 becoming the prevailing variant in the UK. The
      derived estimates of increased transmissibility have uncertainty relating
      to the actual distribution of the generation interval, but they do point,
      under present conditions of vaccination coverage and NPIs, to exponential
      growth of positive cases.

      This was posted on the day Public Health England released a report showing that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is currently 73% of sequenced cases - i.e. it was 73% of new cases a couple of weeks ago. S gene proxy data is only a week out of date and has the prevalence of Delta at 85.4%


      Forget journals not being able to keep up, even preprints can't keep up with this.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: Insights into the ligand-free structure of cyclic diguanosine
      monophosphate I riboswitch of Vibrio cholerae using molecular dynamics
      simulation
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Riboswitches are key cis regulatory elements present at 5' UTRs of
      mRNAs. They play a critical role in gene expression regulation at
      transcriptional and translational level by binding selectively to specific
      ligands followed by conformational changes. Ligands bind to the aptamer of
      riboswitches and their complex structures have been solved, but
      ligand-free riboswitches structures are not available which is important
      to understand specific ligand binding mechanism. In this paper, an all
      atom 150 nano-second (ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cyclic
      diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP I) riboswitch aptamer domain from
      Vibrio cholerae were carried out to study ligand-free c-di-GMP I
      riboswitch aptamer structure and the binding mechanism. The Principle
      component analysis, cross correlation dynamics analysis and trajectory
      analyses revealed that the ligand-free structure has stable conformation
      with folded P2, P3 and an open P1 helix which opens the ligand binding
      helix-join-helix while the ligand-bound structure shows less deviation and
      remains as closed structure compared to the ligand-free structure. The
      junction residues significantly showed anti-correlated motions with each
      other elucidating the open conformation of the ligand-free aptamer of
      riboswitch. The identified key residues involved in binding are A18, G20,
      C46, A47 and C92.

    abstract: The role of T cells in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been
      underestimated in favor of neutralizing antibodies. However, cellular
      immunity is essential for long-term viral control and protection from
      disease severity. To understand T-cell immunity in the absence of antibody
      generation we focused on a group of SARS-CoV-2 Non-Seroconvertors (NSC)
      recovered from infection. We performed an immune comparative analysis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals stratified by the absence or presence of
      seroconversion and disease severity. We report high levels of total naive
      and low effector CD8+ T cells in NSC. Moreover, polyfunctional
      Nucleocapsid (NP)-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, as well as reduced
      levels of T-cell activation monitored by PD-1 and activation-induced
      markers, were distinctive immunological traits in NSC. Longitudinal data
      support the stability of the NSC phenotype over three months. Our results
      implicate highly functional SARS-CoV-2 Spike and NP T-cell responses with
      low immune activation in protection from disease severity in the absence
      of seroconversion.

    title: Mayaro Virus Infection Elicits an Innate Immune Response and Represses
      Autophagy in Anopheles stephensi
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arboviral pathogen in the genus Alphavirus
      that is circulating in South America with potential to spread to naive
      regions. MAYV is also one of the few viruses with the ability to be
      transmitted by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles in addition to the
      typical arbovirus transmitting mosquitoes in the genus Aedes. Few studies
      have investigated the infection response of Anopheles mosquitoes to
      arboviruses. In this study we detail the transcriptomic and small RNA
      responses of An. stephensi to infection with MAYV via infectious bloodmeal
      at 2, 7, and 14 days post infection (dpi). 487 unique transcripts were
      significantly regulated and 79 novel miRNAs were identified. Gene ontology
      analysis of transcripts regulated at each timepoint suggested activation
      of the Toll pathway at 7 dpi and repression of pathways related to
      autophagy at 14 dpi. These findings provide a basic understanding of the
      infection response of An. stephensi to MAYV and help to identify host
      factors which might be useful to target to inhibit viral replication in
      Anopheles mosquitoes.

      nucleus compared to cytosol of mammalian cells
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: An extensive network of chaperones and other proteins maintain protein
      homeostasis and guard against inappropriate protein aggregation that is a
      hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Using a fluorescence resonance
      energy-based biosensor that simultaneously reports on intact cellular
      chaperone holdase activity and detrimental aggregation propensity, we
      investigated the buffering capacity of the systems managing protein
      homeostasis in the nucleus of the human cell line HEK293 compared to the
      cytosol. We found that the nucleus showed lower net holdase activity and
      reduced capacity to suppress protein aggregation, suggesting that the
      nuclear quality control resources are less effective compared to those in
      the cytosol. Aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein (Httex1) in
      the cytosol appeared to deplete cytosolic chaperone supply by depleting
      holdase activity. Unexpectedly, the same stress increased holdase activity
      in the nucleus suggesting that proteostasis stress can trigger a rebalance
      of chaperone supply in different subcellular compartments. Collectively
      the findings suggest the cytosol has more capacity to manage imbalances in
      proteome foldedness than the nucleus, but chaperone supply can be
      redirected into the nucleus under conditions of proteostasis stress caused
      by cytosolic protein aggregation.

      <b>Summary:</b>

      In the cell, there is an extensive network of protein quality control machinery that maintains protein homeostasis. A disruption in this network may lead to protein aggregation, which is a hallmark for many neurodegenerative diseases. This has prompted a need to develop a biosensor that can measure chaperone activity in the cell, which the authors have done in their previous work (Wood, R. et al. 2018. Nat. Comm.). One way to gauge chaperone activity is to measure their ability to bind unfolded proteins, also known as “holdase” activity, to prevent aggregation. We found that the authors give a helpful explanation of how their previously-designed biosensor works, reducing the need for the reader to reference the previous publication.


      In this manuscript, the authors improve upon this tool to include nuclear localization or export sequences (NLS or NES, respectively) to probe protein homeostasis in the nucleus or cytosol, respectively. This control of biosensor localization is very impressive. Using this new capability, they show that 1) holdase activity in the cytosol is more abundant than in the nucleus and 2) imbalance in protein homeostasis - by co-expressing the huntingtin exon 1 mutant -  can reallocate chaperone supply in different areas of the cell. 


      A long-standing view in the proteostasis field is that the quality control machinery is more abundant in the cytosol. Their new biosensor supports this view by showing that there is more holdase activity detected in the cytosol than in the nucleus.


      The authors show that Huntingtin (Htt) inclusions can affect the fluorescence analysis of cells via flow cytometry. We appreciate that they addressed this limitation of their biosensor. They propose a workaround by measuring FRET using microscopy instead of their flow cytometry method. Using this workaround, the authors find evidence that the cell can reallocate quality control machinery between the cytosol and the nucleus.


      By adding the NLS or NES, the authors have extended the biosensor’s capability to answer more questions about proteostasis. While the constructed biosensor only used barnase, which binds to Hsp70 and Hsp40 family chaperones, as the model protein, the scheme suggests a potential to expand the scope of the biosensor by using different model proteins that bind other quality control proteins beyond Hsp70 and Hsp40 families.


      <b>Major Points: </b>


      The authors modify their previously-developed biosensor to restrict its localization to either the cytosol or nucleus using an NES or NLS, respectively. Because protein folding is essential to the biosensor’s function, the authors validate these new modifications by measuring protein stability via urea denaturation of the wild type* (WT*) barnase. The authors only perform the validation for the WT* but not for the mutants. Could the differences in the lower slope gradient observed in Figure 2B for the mutants be due to the NES or NLS affecting the mutant barnase stability differently than WT*? 


      There seems to be a discrepancy between data from Fig 2B and Fig 3B. Fig 2B shows that there is a lower slope gradient in the cytosol than in the nucleus. Looking more closely at Fig 3B, it almost looks like the nucleus has a lower slope gradient than the cytosol. This contradicts the conclusion from Fig 2B that the cytosol has more holdase activity when in Fig 3B, it looks like the nucleus has more. How could these differences be reconciled? 


      <b>Minor Points:</b>


      <u>Introduction:</u>

      In page 1 line 57, the abundance of unfolded-like barnase is not detected by FRET but rather by the absence of FRET


      Duplicate citations on refs. 5 and 6


      In the paragraph that starts on page 1/line 59, I was able to understand the motivation for creating the biosensor. However, the authors go on to explain that they added localization sequences without motivating a reason for why the comparison between the nucleus and the cytosol is important. The authors have this information in their discussion (line 226-227) and a brief mention of this in the introduction would help motivate the study.


      <u>Methods:</u>

      In line 270, it was unclear to me what it means to “decouple the expression of the two plasmids”. More detail in this section would also help in the ease of reproducibility of the work. 


      Catalog numbers should be included for all materials


      In line 280, there’s a typo. “Ovine” should be “bovine”


      We like that the authors provide scripts alongside the example datasets for their image analysis. This aids in reproducibility


      <u>Figure 1:</u>

      Labeling style for Fig 1A could benefit from the cartoon in the style of the (Wood, R. et al. 2018. Nat. Comm. Fig. 1), where the conformations of the bait, as well as the other proteins, were explicitly shown


      We are curious about how the linker control was designed since the linker control was not introduced in the initial biosensor paper (Wood, R. et al. 2018. Nat. Comm.) Which factors determine the linker control’s length and its amino acid sequence? 


      It looks like both localization sequences (NLS and NES) are appended to the biosensor in Fig 1A, which contrasts with what described in the Results.


      Fig 1D, unclear that they didn’t label “D” and “A”


      Mentioning that urea acts as a denaturing agent would be helpful, especially to newcomers unfamiliar with the assay


      <u>Figure 2:</u>

      Figure 2C: How was the percentage of cells with aggregates calculated? Legend of the figure suggest that the percentage is derived from the ratio (upper slope)/(lower slope)


      In Line 113-114, the authors observed that the I25A I96G mutant was potentially outside of the detected dynamic range of the biosensor. However, the I25A,I96G mutant was still used in subsequent experiments without providing further explanations.


      <u>Figure 3:</u>

      Fig 1 and 3, using the same color for the Hoechst dye would help better with continuity across figures


      What drove the choice for using the Y66L Emerald as the transfection control rather than an empty vector? 


      <u>Figure 4:</u>

      It would be useful to see a color map for the FRET map on the side to get a better idea of the range


      What does white or red arrow mean in figure 4? We think that the white arrow indicates inclusion-targeted and the red arrow indicates diffuse-targeted


      The signal that the white arrow is referring to in Figure 4A for the nucleus is barely visible


      In Figure 4, would it be possible to use different line styles for the WT* and the mutants?


      In Figure 4, WT should be labeled as WT*

    title: "Hackflex: low cost Illumina Nextera Flex sequencing library construction"
    category: genomics
    abstract: We developed a low-cost method for the production of
      Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries that allows up to 14 times more
      libraries for high-throughput Illumina sequencing to be generated for the
      same cost. We call this new method Hackflex. Quality of library
      preparation was tested by constructing libraries from E. coli MG1655
      genomic DNA using either Hackflex, standard Nextera Flex or a variation of
      standard Nextera Flex in which the bead-linked transposase is diluted
      prior to use. In order to test the library quality for genomes with a
      higher and a lower GC content, library construction methods were also
      tested on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. aureus ATCC25923, respectively. We
      demonstrated that Hackflex can produce high quality libraries and yields a
      highly uniform coverage, equivalent to the standard Nextera Flex kit. We
      show that strongly size selected libraries produce sufficient yield and
      complexity to support de novo microbial genome assembly, and that
      assemblies of the large insert libraries can be much more contiguous than
      standard libraries without strong size selection. We introduce a new set
      of sample barcodes that are distinct from standard Illumina barcodes,
      enabling Hackflex samples to be multiplexed with samples barcoded using
      standard Illumina kits. Using Hackflex, we were able to achieve a per
      sample reagent cost for library prep of A$7.22 (USD$5.60), which is 9.87
      times lower than the Standard Nextera Flex protocol at advertised retail
      price. An additional simple modification and further simplification of the
      protocol by omitting the wash step enables a further price reduction to
      reach an overall 14-fold cost saving. This method will allow researchers
      to construct more libraries within a given budget, thereby yielding more
      data and facilitating research programs where sequencing large numbers of
      libraries is beneficial.

    title: A scale-dependent measure of system dimensionality
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: A fundamental problem in science is uncovering the effective number of
      dynamical degrees of freedom in a complex system, a quantity that depends
      on the spatio-temporal scale at which the system is observed. Here, we
      propose a scale-dependent generalization of a classic enumeration of
      latent variables, the Participation Ratio. We show how this measure
      relates to conventional quantities such as the Correlation dimension and
      Principal Component Analysis, and demonstrate its properties in dynamical
      systems such as the Lorentz attractor. We apply the method to neural
      population recordings in multiple brain areas and brain states, and
      demonstrate fundamental differences in the effective dimensionality of
      neural activity in behaviorally engaged states versus spontaneous
      activity. Our method applies broadly to multi-variate data across fields
      of science.

      This review was done as part of the SfN Reviewer Mentor Program (Mentor:
      Mike X Cohen, Mentee: Jingwen Li).


      The authors generalized a method of measuring dimensionality, Participation Ratio dimension, to a scale-dependent quantity that captures the dimension at different scales. They verified the quantity on two examples and Gaussian distributions in comparison with the scale-dependent Correlation dimension. They further applied the quantity to different brain regions under different states. I found the methods and results interesting and important, as many complex systems could have dimensionality varying upon the scales. However, my main concern arises when the authors applied the quantity to neural systems. There seems lacking a bridge between the examples and the neural systems analyzed in the study, as well as a clear interpretation of the results. I hope that my comments below will help the authors improve their manuscript.

      1) The definition of distance r is important since the aim of the generalized DPR is to measure dimensionality at different scales. While r used in the examples is spatial distance, the r used in neural system is functional “distance.” It is not clear how these two concepts of distance relate, or whether it is trivial to exchange one for the other. In particular, for the cases where the dimensionality changes with scales (visual cortex, frontal cortex, and midbrain), it’s not clear to me what it means to vary scales in this functional space. Perhaps the authors could include an additional example that validates using spatial, topological, and functional distance measures. This might help the readers smoothly transfer to applications in neural system later in the manuscript. It would also be nice if these examples show different dimensionalities at different scales, as mentioned in discussion.

      2) Relatedly, the interpretation of “dimensionality” in functional space could be more clearly defined. How is this dimensionality related to more commonly used functional metrics like synchronization/noise correlation? For example, as the scale r increases, neurons with a larger functional distance are included, so presumably synchrony of those neurons will decrease. Linking their proposed DPR measure to existing neural synchrony measures (in the four brain regions across two behavioral states) will facilitate a physiological interpretation, and may also help clarify the benefits of DPR. For instance, recent studies found that noise correlation (calculating pairwise correlations of spike counts among neurons) in visual cortex decreases due to locomotion/arousal (Dadarlat & Stryker 2017 J of Neuroscience; Vinck et al 2015 Neuron; Erisken et al 2014 Current Biology). However, the state-dependent decrease of noise correlation is not found in thalamus although firing rate changes with behavioral state (Erisken et al 2014 Current Biology). It would be interesting to compare these findings with the authors’ results in visual cortex and thalamus. This is also interesting because the authors observed lower dimensionality in task-driven states, but active neural processing has been associated with increased synchronization at spatial scales captured by LFP and EEG. Thus, the relationship between dimensionality and synchronization does not seem trivial, and could be very insightful.


      A few minor suggestions:

      1) When using the scale-free Gaussian example, the statement of “systems with such properties are often deemed to be near criticality and are studied in a number of contexts” should be followed by a few citations. Furthermore, it would be helpful if the authors explain how the power law exponent affects the dimensionality in such a system, i.e., the relation of the original Gaussian dimension d and the exponent alpha. This would intuitively explain why DPR saturates at a finite value despite the Gaussian dimension d, although it is derived later by Eq. 5.

      2) In Fig. 1, one of the indices e) is supposed to be d).

      3) In Fig. 3, is data used for b) the same for bottom panels in a), and just rearranged for better presentation? If yes, the authors should indicate in captions of b) for clarification.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    raw_message: The insanity is in thinking that the earth is suddenly flat, and
      that this research paper, done by people outside their specialties with no
      epidemiologists or virologists involved, can overturn all the knowledge we
      have been amassing for over a year. We know, for instance that within
      states, city ordinances change transmission -- and that's all we can
      really talk about when looking at this study. It tries to ask the question
      whether state mandates work to change the mask-wearing and
      distance-keeping behavior of the population, in such a way that the virus
      can be combatted -- or are there enough anti-maskers who refuse to abide,
      who will sabotage public health efforts. So, we know that mask wearing and
      distance-keeping mandates, and more, work at the municipal level to combat
      the virus. We also know, from looking outside the box of just the USA,
      that mandates work when comparing countries to other countries. Let's take
      the case of the phenomen of a couple walking in public, one wearing a
      mask, the other not. The one not masked up has a greater chance of
      contracting the virus, and thus spreading it to the other (and the rest of
      their families), thus negating much of what the masked individual was
      trying to accomplish. We can call this the sabotage factor. In the face of
      the massive amount of information that supports mask wearing, we have to
      really rip this study open to see if it holds the water it pretends to,
      and also, for whatever truth it may hold, what are the social
      implications. The paper simply does not show what many readers would like
      it to show, that the world is flat.

    abstract: The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) has carried out extensive
      rodent toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of radiofrequency radiation
      (RFR) at frequencies and modulations used in the U.S. telecommunications
      industry. This report presents partial findings from these studies. The
      occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed
      to RFR, malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were
      considered of particular interest and are the subject of this report. The
      findings in this report were reviewed by expert peer reviewers selected by
      the NTP and National Institutes of Health (NIH). These reviews and
      responses to comments are included as appendices to this report, and
      revisions to the current document have incorporated and addressed these
      comments. When the studies are completed, they will undergo additional
      peer review before publication in full as part of the NTP's Toxicology and
      Carcinogenesis Technical Reports Series. No portion of this work has been
      submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Supplemental
      information in the form of four additional manuscripts has or will soon be
      submitted for publication. These manuscripts describe in detail the
      designs and performance of the RFR exposure system, the dosimetry of RFR
      exposures in rats and mice, the results to a series of pilot studies
      establishing the ability of the animals to thermoregulate during RFR
      exposures, and studies of DNA damage. (1) Capstick M, Kuster N, Kuhn S,

    title: Sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater anticipates the
      occurrence of COVID-19 cases
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Barcelona sewage long before the
      declaration of the first COVID-19 case, indicating that the infection was
      present in the population before the first imported case was reported.
      Sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater would enable adoption of
      immediate measures in the event of future COVID-19 waves.

    abstract: OASIS-3 is a compilation of MRI and PET imaging and related clinical
      data for 1098 participants who were collected across several ongoing
      studies in the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research
      Center over the course of 15 years. Participants include 605 cognitively
      normal adults and 493 individuals at various stages of cognitive decline
      ranging in age from 42 to 95 years. The OASIS-3 dataset contains over 2000
      MR sessions, including multiple structural and functional sequences. PET
      metabolic and amyloid imaging includes over 1500 raw imaging scans and the
      accompanying post-processed files from the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP) are
      also available in OASIS-3. OASIS-3 also contains post-processed imaging
      data such as volumetric segmentations and PET analyses. Imaging data is
      accompanied by dementia and APOE status and longitudinal clinical and
      cognitive outcomes. OASIS-3 is available as an open access data set to the
      scientific community to answer questions related to healthy aging and
      dementia.

    abstract: The 1918 influenza pandemic was the deadliest respiratory pandemic of
      the 20th century and determined the genomic make-up of subsequent human
      influenza A viruses (IAV). Here, we analyze the first 1918 IAV genomes
      from Europe and from the first, milder wave of the pandemic. 1918 IAV
      genomic diversity is consistent with local transmission and frequent
      long-distance dispersal events and in vitro polymerase characterization
      suggests potential phenotypic variability. Comparison of first and second
      wave genomes shows variation at two sites in the nucleoprotein gene
      associated with resistance to host antiviral response, pointing at a
      possible adaptation of 1918 IAV to humans. Finally, phylogenetic estimates
      based on extended molecular clock modelling suggests a pure pandemic
      descent of seasonal H1N1 IAV as an alternative to the hypothesis of an
      intrasubtype reassortment origin.

    title: Public Perception of COVID-19 Vaccines through Analysis of Twitter
      Content and Users
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: Twitter is a robust medium to understand wide-scale, organic public
      perception about the COVID-19 vaccine. In this cross-sectional
      observational study, we evaluated 2.4 million English tweets from nearly 1
      million user accounts matching keywords (('covid*' OR 'coronavirus') AND
      'vaccine') during vaccine development from Feb 1st through Dec 11th, 2020.
      We applied topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, and demographic
      inference of users on the COVID-19 vaccine related tweets to provide
      insight into the evolution of public attitudes. Individuals generated
      87.9% (n=834,224) of tweets. Of individuals, men (n=560,824) outnumbered
      women (n=273,400) by 2:1 and 39.5% (n=329,776) of individuals were
      [&ge;]40 years old. Daily mean sentiment fluctuated congruent with news
      events, but overall trended positively. Trust, anticipation, and fear were
      the three most predominant emotions; while fear was the most predominant
      emotion early in the study period, trust outpaced fear from April 2020
      onward. Fear was more prevalent in tweets by individuals (26.3% vs.
      organizations 19.4%; p<0.001), specifically among women (28.4% vs. males
      25.4%; p <0.001). Multiple topics had a monthly trend towards more
      positive sentiment. Tweets comparing COVID-19 to the influenza vaccine had
      strongly negative early sentiment but improved over time. Our findings are
      concerning for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, but also identify targets for
      educational interventions.

    title: Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 in the
      working age population - first results from a cohort study in Southern
      Sweden
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Background Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 needs to be assessed
      in diverse real-world population settings. Methods A cohort study of 805
      741 residents in Scania county, Southern Sweden, aged 18-64 years, of whom
      26 587 received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Incidence rates
      of COVID-19 were estimated in sex- and age-adjusted analysis and
      stratified in two-week periods with substantial community spread of the
      disease. Results The estimated vaccine effectiveness in preventing
      infection >7 days after second dose was 86% (95% CI 72-94%) but only 42%
      (95% CI 14-63%) >14 days after a single dose. No difference in vaccine
      effectiveness was observed between females and males. Having a prior
      positive test was associated with 91% (95% CI 85 to 94%) effectiveness
      against new infection among the unvaccinated. Conclusion A satisfactory
      effectiveness of BNT162b2 after the second dose was suggested, but with
      possibly substantially lower effect before the second dose.

    title: Gut microbiota may underlie the predisposition of healthy individuals to
      COVID-19
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally with high disparity in the
      susceptibility of the disease severity. Identification of the key
      underlying factors for this disparity is highly warranted. Here we
      describe constructing a proteomic risk score based on 20 blood proteomic
      biomarkers which predict the progression to severe COVID-19. We
      demonstrate that in our own cohort of 990 individuals without infection,
      this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory
      cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further
      discovered that a core set of gut microbiota could accurately predict the
      above proteomic biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning
      model, and that these gut microbiota features are highly correlated with
      proinflammatory cytokines in another set of 366 individuals. Fecal
      metabolomic analysis suggested potential amino acid-related pathways
      linking gut microbiota to inflammation. This study suggests that gut
      microbiota may underlie the predisposition of normal individuals to severe
      COVID-19.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: Accelerating RepeatClassifier Based on Spark and Greedy Algorithm with
      Dynamic Upper Boundary
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) represent quantitatively important
      components of genome sequences (e.g. 90% of the wheat genome), and play
      important roles in genome organization and evolution. The promotion of
      unsupervised annotation of transposable elements is of great significance.
      Classification is an important step in TE annotation, which summarize the
      information about the type or mechanism for the raw repetitive sequences.
      RepeatClassifier is a basic homology-based classification tool which
      compares the TE families to both the Repeat Protein Database (DB) and
      libraries of RepeatMasker. Unfortunately, RepeatClassifier is inefficient
      and takes a few days to classify the repetitive sequences of large
      genomes. Hence, we proposed Spark-based RepeatClassifier (SRC) which uses
      Greedy Algorithm with Dynamic Upper Boundary (GDUB) for data division and
      load balancing, and Spark to improve the parallelism of RepeatClassifier.
      Experimental results show that SRC can not only ensure the same level of
      accuracy as that of RepeatClassifier, but also achieve 42-88 times of
      acceleration compared to RepeatClassifier. At the same time, SRC shows
      excellent parallel performance when dealing with input datasets with
      unbalanced length distribution.

    title: "Patterning on the move: the effects of Hh morphogen source movement on
      signaling dynamics"
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: Morphogens of the Hh-family trigger gene expression changes of
      receiving cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The outputs of the
      pathway include regulation of cell identity, proliferation, death or
      metabolism, depending on the tissue or organ. This variety of responses
      relies on a conserved signaling pathway. Its internal logic includes a
      negative feedback loop involving the Hh receptor Ptc. In this paper, we
      use experiments and computational models to study and compare the
      different spatial signaling profiles downstream of Hh in several
      developing Drosophila organs. We show that the spatial distribution of Ptc
      and the activator form of the Gli transcription factor, CiA, in wing,
      antenna and ocellus show similar features, but markedly different from
      that in the compound eye (CE). We show that these two profile types
      represent two time points along the signaling dynamics, and that the
      interplay between the spatial displacement of the Hh source in the CE and
      the negative feedback loop maintains the receiving cells effectively in an
      earlier stage of signaling. These results indicate that the dynamics of
      the Hh source strongly influences the signaling profile Hh elicits in
      receiving cells, and show how the interaction between spatial and temporal
      dynamics of signaling and differentiation processes can contribute to the
      informational versatility of the conserved Hh signaling pathway.

    abstract: >-
      Vaccines based on mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a
      promising new platform used by two leading vaccines against coronavirus
      disease in 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations
      present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side
      effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorly
      defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical
      studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these
      LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by
      massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory
      pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
      The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory
      responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate.


      In summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses could stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for human vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this platform.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

    title: "SIR-PID: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller for COVID-19
      Outbreak Containment"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Ongoing social restrictions, as distancing and lockdown, adopted by
      many countries for contrasting the COVID-19 epidemic spread, try to find a
      trade-off between induced economic crisis, healthcare system collapse and
      costs in terms of human lives. Applying and removing restrictions on a
      system with uncontrollable inertia, as represented by an epidemic
      outbreak, may create critical instabilities, overshoots and strong
      oscillations of infected people around the desirable set-point, defined as
      the maximum number of hospitalizations acceptable by a given healthcare
      system. A good understanding of the system reaction to a change of the
      input control variable can be reasonably achieved using a
      proportional-integral-derivative controller, widely used in technological
      applications. In this paper we make use of this basic control theory for
      understanding the reaction of COVID-19 propagation to social restrictions
      and for exploiting a very known technology to reduce the epidemic damages
      through the correct tuning of the containment policy.

    title: Modeling sequence-space exploration and emergence of epistatic signals in
      protein evolution
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: During their evolution, proteins explore sequence space via an
      interplay between random mutations and phenotypic selection. Here we build
      upon recent progress in reconstructing data-driven fitness landscapes for
      families of homologous proteins, to propose stochastic models of
      experimental protein evolution. These models predict quantitatively
      important features of experimentally evolved sequence libraries, like
      fitness distributions and position-specific mutational spectra. They also
      allow us to efficiently simulate sequence libraries for a vast array of
      combinations of experimental parameters like sequence divergence,
      selection strength and library size. We showcase the potential of the
      approach in re-analyzing two recent experiments to determine protein
      structure from signals of epistasis emerging in experimental sequence
      libraries. To be detectable, these signals require sufficiently large and
      sufficiently diverged libraries. Our modeling framework offers a
      quantitative explanation for the variable success of recently published
      experiments. Furthermore, we can forecast the outcome of time- and
      resource-intensive evolution experiments, opening thereby a way to
      computationally optimize experimental protocols.

    title: Brief exposure of neuronal cells to levels of short chain fatty acids
      observed in human systemic circulation impair the cell lipid metabolism
      resulting in associated cell death by apoptosis
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Communication between gut microbiota and the brain is an enigma.
      Alterations in the gut microbial community affects enteric metabolite
      levels, such as SCFAs. SCFAs have been proposed as a possible mechanism
      through which the gut microbiome modulate brain health and function. This
      study analyzed for the first time the effects of SCFAs at levels reported
      in human systemic circulation on human neuronal cell energy metabolism,
      viability, survival and the brain lipidome. Cell and rat brain lipidomics
      was done using UHPLC-HESI-HRAMS/MS. Neuronal cells viability, survival and
      energy metabolism were analyzed via flow cytometer, immunofluorescence,
      and SeahorseXF platform. Lipidomics analysis demonstrated that SCFAs
      significantly remodeled the brain lipidome in vivo and in vitro. The most
      notable remodulation was observed in the metabolism of
      phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens, and mitochondrial lipids carnitine
      and cardiolipin. Increased mitochondrial mass, fragmentation, and
      hyperfusion occurred concomitant with the altered mitochondrial lipid
      metabolism resulting in decreased neuronal cell respiration, ATP
      production, and increased cell death. This suggests SCFAs at levels
      observed in human systemic circulation can adversely alter the brain
      lipidome and neuronal cell function potentially negatively impacting brain
      health outcomes.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

    title: Enhancing Mask Activity in Dopaminergic Neurons Extends Lifespan in Flies
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) are essential modulators for brain
      functions involving memory formation, reward processing, and decision
      making. Here I demonstrate a novel and important function of the DANs in
      regulating aging and longevity. Overexpressing the putative scaffolding
      protein Mask in two small groups of DANs in flies can significantly extend
      the lifespan in flies and sustain adult locomotor and fecundity at old
      ages. Such a Mask-induced beneficial effect requires dopaminergic
      transmission but cannot be recapitulated by elevating dopamine production
      in the DANs. Independent activation of Gs in the same two groups of DANs
      via the drug-inducible DREADD system also extends fly lifespan, further
      indicating the connection of specific DANs to aging control. The
      Mask-induced lifespan extension appears to depend on the function of Mask
      to regulate microtubule (MT) stability. A structure-function analysis
      demonstrated that the ankyrin repeats domain in the Mask protein is both
      necessary for regulating MT stability (when expressed in muscles and motor
      neurons) and sufficient to prolong longevity (when expressed in the two
      groups of DANs). Furthermore, DAN-specific overexpression of Unc-104 or
      knockdown of p150Glued, two independent interventions previously shown to
      impact MTs dynamics, also extend lifespan in flies. Together these data
      demonstrated a novel DANs-dependent mechanism that, upon neuronal
      cell-type specific tuning of MT dynamics, modulates systemic aging and
      longevity in flies.

      This was a great and very interesting paper to read. The figures were easy
      to read and use of the color was really helpful to visualize the results.
      However, I think that in figure 1D, including a table or figure legend to
      explain what the various colors are in the diagram would be very helpful.
      Also, the paper and figures switch between referring to PAM dopaminergic
      neurons as 0273, which can be a little confusing, so keeping the notation
      consistent would be great. 


      I understand that you overexpress Mask from birth, but would it be possible to let the flies grow up and then induce Mask overexpression to see whether the same phenotype is observed? This could avoid any complications with Mask’s potential role in development and other signaling pathways. Also, exploring what the flies are dying of that Mask overexpression avoids would make your argument of Mask’s role in increasing survivorship stronger. I found it very interesting that increasing microtubule dynamics increased lifespan, but I think that more clearly showing how/why Mask increases microtubule dynamics would strengthen the association between microtubules, Mask, and lifespan. Perhaps including a coimmunoprecipitation to show Mask’s interacting partners or showing how Unc-104 or P150 glued are affected due to Mask overexpression would make this association clearer. 


      It is truly commendable you were able to generate these results on your own, so please keep up the great work! I look forward to reading your future research

    title: "ANTsX: A dynamic ecosystem for quantitative biological and medical
      imaging"
    category: radiology-and-imaging
    abstract: The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists
      of multiple open-source software libraries which house top-performing
      algorithms used worldwide by scientific and research communities for
      processing and analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base
      software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the
      NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded
      Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has
      since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements
      include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through
      interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python
      (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions
      ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries)
      contain several popular network architectures and trained models for
      specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep
      learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural
      T1-weighted brain MRI. Not only does this significantly improve
      computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over
      multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs pipelines but it also
      illustrates the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a
      framework for medical image analysis.

    abstract: Genomic profiling has unveiled the molecular subtypes and mutational
      landscape of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, there is a
      knowledge gap on the consistency of gene expression across PDAC tumors
      profiled in independent studies and this limits follow up research. To
      facilitate novel drug target prioritization and biomarker discovery, we
      investigated the most consistently expressed genes in human PDAC. We
      identified ~4,000 genes highly or lowly expressed in at least 4 of 5
      microarrays (adjusted P<0.05) and validated their expression pattern in
      additional datasets, bulk tumor and single-cell RNA sequencing samples.
      Over 50% of the genes were previously uncharacterized in PDAC; many
      correlated with proliferation, metastasis, mutation, tumor grade, and ~41%
      predicted overall survival. We identified 185 high-priority targets
      (notably in cell cycle and glycolysis) whose inhibition suppressed PDAC
      cell viability in multiple RNA interference datasets and these genes
      predicted treatment in mouse models. Our results represent important
      milestone in the quest for mechanisms, drug targets and biomarkers in
      PDAC, and originate from an adaptable analytical concept that can aid
      discovery in other cancers.

    title: A multicentric, randomized, controlled phase III study of centhaquine
      (Lyfaquin(R)) as a resuscitative agent in hypovolemic shock patients
    category: intensive-care-and-critical-care-medicine
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Centhaquine (Lyfaquin(R)) showed significant safety and
      efficacy in preclinical and clinical phase I and II studies. METHODS: A
      prospective, multicentric, randomized phase III study was conducted in
      patients with hypovolemic shock having systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
      [&le;]90 mm Hg and blood lactate levels of [&ge;]2 mmol/L. Patients were
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio, 71 patients to the centhaquine group and 34
      patients to the control (saline) group. Every patient received standard of
      care (SOC) and was followed for 28 days. The study drug (normal saline or
      centhaquine (0.01 mg/kg)) was administered in 100 mL of normal saline
      infusion over 1 hour. The primary objectives were to determine changes
      (mean through 48 hours) in SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood
      lactate levels, and base deficit. The secondary objectives included the
      amount of fluids, blood products, vasopressors administered in the first
      48 hours, duration of hospital stay, time in ICU, time on the ventilator
      support, change in patient's Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),
      Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) scores, and the proportion of
      patients with 28-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of
      patients and baseline vitals in both groups were comparable. Trauma was
      the cause of hypovolemic shock in 29.41% of control and 47.06% of
      centhaquine, gastroenteritis in 44.12% of control, and 29.41% of
      centhaquine patients. An equal amount of fluids and blood products were
      administered in both groups during the first 48 hours of resuscitation. A
      lesser amount of vasopressors was needed in the first 48 hours of
      resuscitation in the centhaquine group. An increase in SBP from the
      baseline was consistently higher in the centhaquine group than in the
      control. A significant increase in pulse pressure in the centhaquine group
      than the control group suggests improved stroke volume due to centhaquine.
      The shock index was significantly lower in the centhaquine group than
      control from 1 hour (p=0.0320) till 4 hours (p=0.0494) of resuscitation.
      Resuscitation with centhaquine had a significantly greater number of
      patients with improved blood lactate and the base deficit than the control
      group. ARDS and MODS improved with centhaquine, and an 8.8% absolute
      reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed in the centhaquine
      group. CONCLUSION: Centhaquine is a highly efficacious resuscitative agent
      for treating hypovolemic shock. The efficacy of centhaquine in
      distributive shock due to sepsis and COVID-19 is being explored. The study
      protocol (PMZ-2010/CT-3.1/2018) was approved by the Drug Controller
      General of India (DCGI), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government
      of India, and Institutional Ethics Committee of all the 14 Institutions."

    title: "STARsolo: accurate, fast and versatile mapping/quantification of
      single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: We present STARsolo, a comprehensive turnkey solution for quantifying
      gene expression in single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq data, built into RNA-seq
      aligner STAR. Using simulated data that closely resembles realistic
      scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that STARsolo is highly accurate and
      significantly outperforms pseudoalignment-to-transcriptome tools. STARsolo
      can replicate the results of, but is considerably faster than CellRanger,
      currently the most widely used tool for pre-processing scRNA-seq data. In
      addition to uniquely mapped reads, STARsolo takes account of multi-gene
      reads, necessary to detect certain classes of biologically important
      genes. It has a flexible cell barcode processing scheme, compatible with
      many established scRNA-seq protocols, and extendable to emerging
      technologies. STARsolo can quantify transcriptomic features beyond gene
      expression, which we illustrate by analyzing cell-type-specific
      alternative splicing in the Tabula Muris project.

      Hi,


      Thank you very much for posting this preprint.


      I am working on trying to read through the manuscript more carefully, which I hope can improve my understanding of <i>STARsolo</i> as well the regular <i>STAR</i> alignment.  I also thought the different results with varying settings of <i>Alevin</i> was interesting and important.


      However, in the meantime, I believe that you have a minor error in one of your references:


      [30]. R. S. Brüning et al. Comparative Analysis of Common Alignment Tools for Single Cell RNA Sequencing. <u><b>preprint. Bioinformatics</b></u>, 2021. doi: 10.1101/2021.02.15.430948.


      I think this should be a bioRxiv preprint (not a Bioinformatics preprint)?


      For example, the DOI leads to this reference:


      https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.430948v2


      Thanks Again,

      Charles

    title: Loose ends in cancer genome structure
    category: genomics
    abstract: Recent pan-cancer studies have delineated patterns of structural
      genomic variation across thousands of tumor whole genome sequences. It is
      not known to what extent the shortcomings of short read ([&le;] 150 bp)
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) used for structural variant analysis has
      limited our understanding of cancer genome structure. To formally address
      this, we introduce the concept of "loose ends" - copy number alterations
      that cannot be mapped to a rearrangement by WGS but can be indirectly
      detected through the analysis of junction-balanced genome graphs.
      Analyzing 2,319 pan-cancer WGS cases across 31 tumor types, we found loose
      ends were enriched in reference repeats and fusions of the mappable genome
      to repetitive or foreign sequences. Among these we found genomic
      footprints of neotelomeres, which were surprisingly enriched in cancers
      with low telomerase expression and alternate lengthening of telomeres
      phenotype. Our results also provide a rigorous upper bound on the role of
      non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) in large-scale cancer
      structural variation, while nominating INO80, FANCA, and ARID1A as
      positive modulators of somatic NAHR. Taken together, we estimate that
      short read WGS maps >97% of all large-scale (>10 kbp) cancer structural
      variation; the rest represent loose ends that require long molecule
      profiling to unambiguously resolve. Our results have broad relevance for
      future research and clinical applications of short read WGS and delineate
      precise directions where long molecule studies might provide
      transformative insight into cancer genome structure.

      Very catchy title and some quite interesting results. Xiaotong Yao
      suggested I raise my terminology concerns as a biorxiv comment:

      ‘Loose ends’ is a catchy title but I am concerned that the use of new terminology for existing concepts has the potential to confuse readers. The definition you are using for ‘loose ends’ is equivalent to concept of a single breakend variant defined in the VCFv4.1 specifications about a decade ago.
       
      Whilst it is only recently that variant callers have actually explicitly reported VCF single breakends (GRIDSS2 from SR/OEA/breakend assemblies, PURPLE from unexplained CN transitions), the loose end/single breakend concept has a long history of implicit usage. For example, NovelSeq (Sahinalp, 2010) uses an orientation-constrained assembly approach (OEA+/OEA-) very similar to that of jabba to produce what this paper calls loose end assemblies (although what NovelSeq does afterwards is different). The assembly similarity can also be seen in GRIDSS1 which uses the terms ‘breakend assembly’ and ‘anchoring reads’ when discussing it’s separate assemblies of forward/- and backward/+ orientation reads/breaks. Viral integration detection software has a similar history of implicit usage of loose ends/single breakends without explicitly using either terminology (only the recently published VIRUSBreakend uses the term).
       
      In summary, this paper would benefit from briefing mentioning the long history of the loose end concept, and how it has been incorporated into existing tools.
       
      ---

      Some additional thoughts to consider:
       
      One interesting benchmarking comparison you could incorporate is against WEAVER. It also generates junction-balanced breakpoint graphs using integer programming, but its conceptual model does not appear to include single breakends. In my benchmarking (https://doi.org/10.1101/781013, Figure 3), I found that weaver failed badly on some samples and I suspect this was due to missing high copy SVs causing all junction balancing solutions to be terrible (thus reporting unbelievable ASCNs). Comparing to WEAVER (or comparing jabba MIP results with/without single breakend support) would be a good demonstration of how essential single breakend support is to the junction balancing process itself.
       
      > we found that almost half (48%, 12,068 of 25,271) of loose ends arose from Type 0 junctions that were missed during genome-wide analysis”
       
      Is this a consequence of waiting till after SV and CN calling is done before looking for single breakends or due to the choice of caller? Would another SV caller (e.g. manta) reduce this? How many of the single breakends found by jabba can be found by stand-alone single breakend SV calling (e.g. GRIDSS2)? I notice jabba allows a BND style VCF input. Does it support single breakend BND calls?


      Single breakend from SV calling and single breakends unbalanced CN junctions seems very much like they are complementary approaches so combining them should improve the final jabba results. I suspect this will be especially true for complex events as they frequently containing many clustered SVs and accurate copy number determination becomes more difficult the shorter the CN segments become.

    title: A massively parallel reporter assay reveals focused and broadly encoded
      RNA localization signals in neurons
    category: genomics
    abstract: "Asymmetric subcellular localization of mRNA is a common cellular
      phenomenon that is thought to contribute to spatial gene regulation. In
      highly polar neurons, subcellular transcript localization and translation
      are thought to enhance cellular efficiency and timely responses to
      external cues. Although mRNA localization has been observed in many
      tissues and numerous examples of the functional importance of this process
      exist, we still lack a systematic understanding of how the transcript
      sorting machinery works in a sequence-specific manner. Here, we addressed
      these gaps by combining subcellular transcriptomics and rationally
      designed sequence libraries. We developed a massively parallel reporter
      assay (MPRA) for mRNA localization and tested ~50,000 sequences for their
      ability to drive RNA localization to neurites of neuronal cell lines. By
      scanning the 3'UTR of >300 genes we identified many previously unknown
      localization regions and mapped the localization potential of endogenous
      sequences. Our data suggest two ways the localization potential can be
      encoded in the 3'UTR: focused localization motifs and broadly encoded
      localization potential based on small contributions. We identified
      sequence motifs enriched in dendritically localized transcripts and tested
      the potential of these motifs to affect the localization behavior of an
      mRNA. This assay revealed sequence elements with the ability to bias
      localization towards neurite as well as soma. Depletion of RNA binding
      proteins predicted or experimentally shown to bind these motifs abolished
      the effect on localization, suggesting that these motifs act by recruiting
      specific RNA-binding proteins. Based on our dataset we developed machine
      learning models that accurately predict the localization behavior of novel
      sequences. Testing this predictor on native mRNA sequencing data showed
      good agreement between predicted and observed localization potential,
      suggesting that the rules uncovered by our MPRA also apply to the
      localization of native transcripts. Applying similar systematic
      high-throughput approaches to other cell types will open the door for a
      comparative perspective on RNA localization across tissues and reveal the
      commonalities and differences of this crucial regulatory mechanism."

      Summary:

      This manuscript by Mikl, M., et al, aims to understand how RNA transcript subcellular localization signals are encoded in 3’ UTR sequences. To this end, the authors designed an MPRA to test thousands of 3’ UTR sequences in parallel. The authors transfect the library to neural cells grown in microporous membranes which allows them to separate the soma from the neurites and subsequently sequence the transcripts in each. The results from the MPRA demonstrate that only a subset of transcripts are enriched in the soma or neurites fractions and localization signals encoded in the 3’ UTR are sufficient to drive transcript localization. The authors then validate a subset of their enriched transcripts via smFISH demonstrating their MPRA mimics endogenous transcript localization. The authors proceed to analyze the sequence of enriched transcripts via mutagenesis and insertions which elucidates that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) largely prevent localization of transcripts to neurites. The authors then follow up their investigations with the creation and validation of longer, novel synthetic 3’UTR sequences capable of neurite enrichment, with subsequent biochemical pulldowns of cell lysates identifying RBP’s necessary for localization. Utilizing their vast dataset of 3’UTR localizing motifs, the authors generated two computational models, one trained on known RBP binding sites and the other assessing all possible sets of 4mers within the sequence, that could successfully predict the localization behavior of unseen 3’UTRs through the estimation of the combined contributions of multiple individual directing sequence elements.


      The major success of this manuscript is in the development of a high-throughput assay to elucidate 3’ UTR encoded transcript localization signals and generation of machine learning models that predict subcellular transcript localization. Overall, we think this manuscript is of high impact and relevance to understand the mechanisms underlying mRNA transcript localization. 


      Below are the major and minor points that should be addressed before the manuscript is published to aid interpretation. 


      Major Points:

      A major concern we have is that the authors mention previous transcript localization studies have very little overlap on enriched dendritically localized transcripts. The authors attributed the lack of overlap to different experimental set ups and cell-types used.  Therefore, the manuscript would be improved by adding a brief explanation as to how their experimental set up and cell types used contrast with previous methods and why their approach might be a better method to identify localization signals encoded in the RNA transcripts. Is there any agreement with previous studies that shed light on biases of the different approaches? Comments on these points will assure readers of the broader significance of their findings and not just the cell type used in the study. 


      Reasoning for the cell type used (CAD and Neuro2a cells) is not explained until the discussion and when mentioned it is not very clear. The manuscript would benefit from a brief explanation of cell type choice when authors explain the final library is transfected into CAD and Neuro2a cells in the results section. 
       
      Regarding the differentiation protocol of Neuro2a and CAD cells, the authors mention in the methods section that they induced differentiation via serum starvation to differentiate cells into a “more neuron-like phenotype”. However, they do not specify at what day post-differentiation the MPRA experiment is done. Consider adding the day of differentiation assays are done. Also,  the manuscript would greatly benefit from IF, qPCR, or WB for neuronal markers to know the cell-type population used in this study, as transcriptional control is largely cell-type dependent. 


      Minor Points:

      Not clear if or how the author's account for the effects differential expression of transcripts and transfection of constructs might have on their output library. 


      Figure 1A: The experimental outline can be improved to aid the reader understand the library design. The construct used in the library could be edited to include what promoter is upstream of GFP, GFP, the 12 nucleotide barcode, the 150 nucleotide sequence, and the pA-site.



      When the authors test the hypothesis that localization potential in RNA is broadly encoded in the 3’ UTR they refer to the experimental setup from Taliaferro et al., 2016 (second line on page 7). To make the experiments clearer for researchers across fields, we suggest adding a brief explanation of the experimental set up. 


      Figure 2: This figure could be improved by re-organizing the order of the panels such that it is easier for the redear to follow the panels from A to F. 
       
      Figure 2D: Not entirely clear why they include St6gal1 on figure 2D without mentioning in the text. We suggest adding a sentence explanation in the main text. 


      Figure 2D and 2E: For smFISH images and quantification, was there a control construct with just GFP? If data is available, the authors should show the image of the ‘normal’ distribution of GFP and then use it as a normalization control for their quantification on 2E. 
       
      Figure 2: No example graph of a broadly encoded transcript is included. Since this is a major conclusion from the paper we suggest the graph to be moved from the supplementary figures to figure 2.  


      In the main text when authors explain the broadly encoded signals might have “many small contributions making up the net localization behavior” it is not clear what they mean by that. A brief explanation of what “small contributions” could be will help make their results more clear to the reader. 


      For RNAi experiments, it is not clear the extent of knockdown for targets as qRT-PCR data mentioned in the methods section is not presented. The qRT-PCR data should be included in the supplementary figures.


      When AGGUA is inserted 1 to 4 times (5th line on page 9) Where is the sequence inserted (at what position(s), throughout the transcript, one after another, etc.)?


      After the knockdown experiments the authors state that “Dazap1 is one mechanism underlying soma enrichment”. To ascertain this is the mechanism responsible for retention of transcripts in the soma, the knockdown experiments could benefit by the addition of rescuing DAzap1 and see if that rescues the negative effect. 


      It is unclear as to how the MEME Suite generates the de novo synthetic sequences, how many were generated, and what was the range in sequence lengths. A brief, yet more explicit description in the main text of how these synthetic sequences were generated and then ‘introduced in native contexts’, e.g. were they added to the end/beginning/within existing 3’UTRs, would help the reader better understand your experimentation.


      Figure 4B and 4C: The vast majority of the synthetic motifs appear to be shifted towards more negative logFC’s indicating increased soma localization. While the success of SU1 is impressive, the low replicability should be mentioned as a caveat in the main text and it’s potential causes speculated upon in the discussion.


      The analysis of the proteomics data should be better explained either within the text or figure captions. Figures 5B, 5D, and 5E are very difficult to understand without any explanation as to how to interpret them in the text. 


      Figure 5: It appears that the plots in Figure 5D and 5E have been switched based on their references in the main text.


      The font size of Figure 5C, 5D, and 5E is much too small to be legible and easily understood.


      Figure 5F: It would greatly help with clarity for the meaning of the red vertical line to be indicated within the plot itself and not solely within the figure caption as it is vital for data interpretation.


      Consider adding more background into why Celf1 and Celf6 were chosen for validation over the other 23 identified proteins. It would be valuable to state the known, or utilize experimentation to determine, the pathway by which these proteins binding to the 3’UTR shuttles them to the neurite. In other words, what is the entire mechanism for neurite localization, not just the identity of the RBP. 


      There is an inconsistency in the spelling of ‘4mer’ (as spelled in the main text and caption) and ‘fourmer’ as it appears in Figure 6A. There is also never a direct definition of what the 4mers are and what information they convey to the computational model. 


      Some speculation into the power of your computational model would be helpful in the determination of its use in future projects. How might further iterations and optimizations be done to improve the auROC?

    title: Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and intra-host evolution in association
      with advanced HIV infection
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: While most people effectively clear SARS-CoV-2, there are several
      reports of prolonged infection in immunosuppressed individuals. Here we
      present a case of prolonged infection of greater than 6 months with the
      shedding of high titter SARS-CoV-2 in an individual with advanced HIV and
      antiretroviral treatment failure. Through whole-genome sequencing at
      multiple time points, we demonstrate the early emergence of the E484K
      substitution associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, followed
      by other escape mutations and the N501Y substitution found in most
      variants of concern. This provides support to the hypothesis of intra-host
      evolution as one mechanism for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with
      immune evasion properties.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    abstract: Departing from classical rule-based linguistic models, advances in
      deep learning have led to the development of a new family of
      self-supervised deep language models (DLMs). These models are trained
      using a simple self-supervised autoregressive objective, which aims to
      predict the next word in the context of preceding words in real-life
      corpora. After training, autoregressive DLMs are able to generate new
      'context-aware' sentences with appropriate syntax and convincing semantics
      and pragmatics. Here we provide empirical evidence for the deep connection
      between autoregressive DLMs and the human language faculty using a 30-min
      spoken narrative and electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings.
      Behaviorally, we demonstrate that humans have a remarkable capacity for
      word prediction in natural contexts, and that, given a sufficient context
      window, DLMs can attain human-level prediction performance. Next, we
      leverage DLM embeddings to demonstrate that many electrodes spontaneously
      predict the meaning of upcoming words, even hundreds of milliseconds
      before they are perceived. Finally, we demonstrate that contextual
      embeddings derived from autoregressive DLMs capture neural representations
      of the unique, context-specific meaning of words in the narrative. Our
      findings suggest that deep language models provide an important step
      toward creating a biologically feasible computational framework for
      generative language.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    raw_message: It's heartbreaking to me that all those hundreds, perhaps
      thousands, of NYC patients in the spring of 2020 were left to sit around
      at home until they could barely breath and were then hospitalized and put
      on ventilators, and were denied HCQ, which may have saved hundreds of
      lives.  Truly sickening, imo.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    raw_message: This would coincide with virtually all other RNA respiratory
      viruses studied.  I am surprised that the initial instinct seems to be
      resistant to recognizing that natural immunity would be inferior to
      induced immunity when we have no precedent to suggest that would be the
      case.

      6 months post covid and I refuse to get vaccinated when my antibody test
      came in at over 300--I never wear a mask and I don't social distance.

      it's possible, but not relevant.  Control for behavior of the subjects
      would be true of all--yes or no previously infected, yes or no vaccinated,
      yes or no both; maybe they all changed their behavior, maybe some a
      little, maybe some no change, it matters not the the point of the
      study.  Furthermore your characterization of "the low rate of
      re-infection" shows your unexplained bias.  It wasn't "low" IT WAS ZERO.

      NOT ONE SUBJECT, PREVIOUSLY INFECTED, HAD A RE-INFECTION.

      This is consistent with all history of coronavirus infections, and viral infections in general.  Even after antibodies have subsided, they will re-surge when presented with the virus at a later date--even many decades.

      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing the ongoing pandemic which
      already led to >129 millions of infections and >2.8 millions of deaths.
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been shown to own promising potential in
      clinically combating SARS-CoV-2 but the underlying mechanisms remain
      highly elusive and its action sites were proposed all on the host cells.
      Very recently, by NMR spectroscopy, for the first time we have decoded
      that HCQ specifically binds both N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal
      domain (CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit their
      interactions with nucleic acids (NAs), as well as to disrupt its
      NA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) essential for the viral
      life cycle including the final package of gRNA and N protein into new
      virions. Here with NMR-derived constraints, we constructed the structure
      of the HCQ-CTD complex in which HCQ binds two pockets on the dimeric CTD.
      This unexpected finding thus allowed us to formulate a design strategy by
      linking two HCQ together to generate a bivalent/multivalent binder for
      CTD. The linked molecule is anticipated to have significantly enhanced
      affinity and specificity in binding CTD. We are willing to collaborate
      with synthetic chemists on this strategy by experimentally charactering
      the synthetic molecules on their binding and effects on LLPS of SARS-CoV-2
      N protein.

      individuals who were previously infected and unvaccinated, I question that
      this study has enough statistical power to support the bold claims in the

      More at play than precautions. It shouldn’t be a surprise that natural
      antibodies protect against the disease…they are antibodies after all. The
      question will be, “how long do natural antibodies last vs those generated
      by the vaccine?”

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: Novel zebrafish mutants reveal new roles for Apolipoprotein B during
      embryonic development and pathological conditions
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is the primary protein of chylomicrons, VLDLs
      and LDLs and is essential for their assembly. Defects in ApoB synthesis
      and secretion result in several human diseases, including
      abetalipoproteinemia and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. Conversely,
      high levels of APOB in plasma are associated with increased risk for
      coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. The involvement of APOB in
      lipid metabolism and atherogenesis prompted the generation of several
      mutant mice. However, as APOB is required for supplying nutrients to the
      developing embryo, ApoB null mice are embryonic lethal, thereby precluding
      the study of the roles of this protein during development. Here, we
      established novel zebrafish mutants for two apoB genes: apoBa and apoBb.1.
      Double-mutant embryos display hepatic steatosis, a common hallmark of
      FHBL1 and NAFLD. In addition, we detect early developmental defects in
      double apoB mutants, including abnormal liver laterality, decreased
      numbers of goblet cells in the gut and impaired angiogenesis. We further
      use these models to identify the domains within ApoB responsible for its
      functions. By assessing the ability of different truncated forms of human
      APOB to rescue the mutant phenotypes, we demonstrate the benefits of this
      model for prospective therapeutic screens. Overall, our novel zebrafish
      models uncover new functions of ApoB in organ development and
      morphogenesis and shed new light on the mechanisms underlying
      hypolipidemia-related diseases."

      For Figure 2, no WT shown which would be good for a reference. In 2C, it
      is unclear what is happening. A suggestion is to zoom out for a better
      image or do a zoomed out pic with a zoomed in figure beside it.
      Additionally, are both prox1a and tfa necessary? One subfigure could
      potentially be put in supplemental. Labels for arrows would also be
      helpful for 2D, F, and H. There also appears to be an inconsistency with
      dpf in the figure. Is the prox1a expression gone by 4 dpf? The reasoning
      for only showing 2 dpf might be needed. Concerning Figure 2F, a suggestion
      is to have a graph show foxa2 expression over time (1.5 dpf to 2.5 dpf).
      There also seems to be a resolution issue throughout the figure. A
      potential fix would be for 2F, to possibly trace it. To support claim and
      significance, we would also like to see more animals and different time
      points.


      A potential future experiment could be the use of an organoid.


      Moreover, I understand that the main idea of the paper is prove that zebrafish can be used as model system by conducting the experiments in various organ systems. But I believe that this point is kind of understand and people would normally get lost in the details of the figure and forget why you conducted experiments in different organ systems. Therefore, for this it would be better to mention and repeat it so that we understand the reason for the transition.

    title: The structure and spontaneous curvature of clathrin lattices at the
      plasma membrane.
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: >-
      Clathrin mediated endocytosis is the primary pathway for receptor and
      cargo internalization in eukaryotic cells. It is characterized by a
      polyhedral clathrin lattice that coats budding membranes. The mechanism
      and control of lattice assembly, curvature, and vesicle formation at the
      plasma membrane has been a matter of longstanding debate. Here, we use
      platinum replica and cryo electron microscopy and tomography to present a
      global structural framework of the pathway. We determine the shape and
      size parameters common to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that
      clathrin sites maintain a constant surface area during curvature across
      multiple cell lines. Flat clathrin is present in all cells and
      spontaneously curves into coated pits without additional energy sources or
      recruited bending factors. Finally, we attribute curvature generation to
      loosely connected and pentagon-containing flat lattices that can rapidly
      curve when a flattening force is released. Together, these data present a
      new universal mechanistic model of clathrin mediated endocytosis.

    title: Neutralization against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 with sera of COVID-19
      recovered cases and vaccinees of BBV152
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Recently, multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants have been detected across the
      globe.The recent emergence of B.1.617 lineage has created serious public
      health problem in India. The high transmissibility was observed with this
      lineage which has led to daily increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2
      infections. Apparently, the sub-lineage B.1.617.2 has slowly dominated the
      other variants including B1617.1, B.617.3 and B.1.1.7. With this, World
      Health Organization has described B.1.617.2 as variant of concern. Besides
      this, variant of concern B.1.351 has been also reported from India, known
      to showreducedefficacyfor many approved vaccines. With the increasing
      threat of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is imperative to assess the efficacy
      of the currently available vaccines against these variants. Here, we have
      evaluated the neutralization potential of sera collected from COVID-19
      recovered cases (n=20) and vaccinees with two doses of BBV152 (n=17)
      against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 compared to the prototype B.1 (D614G)
      variant.The finding of the study demonstrated a reduction in
      neutralization titers with sera of COVID-19 recovered cases(3.3-fold and
      4.6-fold) and BBV152 vaccinees (3. 0 and 2.7 fold) against B.1.351 and
      B.1.617.2 respectively. Although, there is reduction in neutralization
      titer, the whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152)
      demonstrates protective response against VOC B.1351 and B.1.617.2.

    category: neuroscience

    abstract: Nociceptors are specialized sensory neurons that detect damaging or
      potentially damaging stimuli and are found in the dorsal root (DRG) and
      trigeminal ganglia. These neurons are critical for the generation of
      neuronal signals that ultimately create the perception of pain. These
      neurons are also primary targets for acute and chronic pain therapeutics.
      Single-cell transcriptomics on mouse nociceptors has transformed our
      understanding of pain mechanisms. We sought to generate equivalent
      information for human nociceptors with the goal of identifying
      transcriptomic signatures of nociceptors, identifying species differences
      and elucidating new drug targets. We used spatial transcriptomics to
      molecularly characterize transcriptomes of single dorsal root ganglion
      (DRG) neurons from 8 organ donors. We identified 12 clusters of human
      sensory neurons, 5 of which are C nociceptors; as well as 1 Abeta;
      nociceptor, 2 Adelta;, 2 Abeta; and 1 proprioceptor subtypes. By focusing
      on expression profiles for ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors
      (GPCRs) and other pharmacological targets, we provide a rich map of drug
      targets in the human DRG with direct comparison to mouse sensory neuron
      transcriptomes. We also compare human DRG neuronal subtypes to non-human
      primates showing conserved patterns of gene expression among many cell
      types, but divergence among specific nociceptor subsets. Finally, we
      identify sex differences in human DRG subpopulation transcriptomes,
      including a marked increase in CALCA expression in female pruritogen
      receptor enriched nociceptors. Our data open the door to development of
      drug discovery programs for new pain targets and unparalleled molecular
      characterization of clinical sensory disorders.

    title: Brain charts for the human lifespan
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Over the past 25 years, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in
      basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, there are
      no reference standards against which to anchor measures of individual
      differences in brain morphology, in contrast to growth charts for traits
      such as height and weight. Here, we built an interactive online resource
      (www.brainchart.io) to quantify individual differences in brain structure
      from any current or future magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, against
      models of expected age-related trends. With the goal of basing these on
      the largest and most inclusive dataset, we aggregated MRI data spanning
      115 days post-conception through 100 postnatal years, totaling 122,123
      scans from 100,071 individuals in over 100 studies across 6 continents.
      When quantified as centile scores relative to the reference models,
      individual differences show high validity with non-MRI brain growth
      estimates and high stability across longitudinal assessment. Centile
      scores helped identify previously unreported brain developmental
      milestones and demonstrated increased genetic heritability compared to
      non-centiled MRI phenotypes. Crucially for the study of brain disorders,
      centile scores provide a standardised and interpretable measure of
      deviation that reveals new patterns of neuroanatomical differences across
      neurological and psychiatric disorders emerging during development and
      ageing. In sum, brain charts for the human lifespan are an essential first
      step towards robust, standardised quantification of individual variation
      and for characterizing deviation from age-related trends. Our global
      collaborative study provides such an anchorpoint for basic neuroimaging
      research and will facilitate implementation of research-based standards in
      clinical studies.

    title: PRDM9 losses in vertebrates are coupled to the loss of at least three
      other meiotic genes
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: "In most mammals and likely throughout vertebrates, the gene PRDM9
      specifies the locations of meiotic double strand breaks; in mice and
      humans at least, it also aids in their repair. For both roles, many of the
      molecular partners remain unknown. Here, we take a phylogenetic approach
      to identify genes that may be interacting with PRDM9, by leveraging the
      fact that PRDM9 arose before the origin of vertebrates, but was lost many
      times, either partially or entirely--and with it, its role in
      recombination. As a first step, we characterize PRDM9 domain composition
      across 379 vertebrate species, inferring at least eight independent
      losses. We then use the interdigitation of PRDM9 orthologs across
      vertebrates to test whether it co-evolved with any of 241 candidate genes
      co-expressed with PRDM9 in mice or associated with recombination
      phenotypes in mammals. Accounting for the phylogenetic relationship among
      species, we identify three genes whose presence and absence is
      unexpectedly coincident with that of PRDM9: ZCWPW1, which was recently
      shown to be recruited to sites of PRDM9 binding and to facilitate double
      strand break repair; TEX15, which has also been suggested to play a role
      in repair; and ZCWPW2, the paralog of ZCWPW1. ZCWPW2 is expected to be
      recruited to sites of PRDM9 binding as well; its tight coevolution with
      PRDM9 across vertebrates suggests that it is a key interactor, with a role
      either in recruiting the recombination machinery or in double strand break
      repair."

      this change."

    title: "Preprints in motion: tracking changes between posting and journal
      publication"
    category: scientific-communication-and-education
    abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints in the biomedical sciences are
      being posted and accessed at unprecedented rates, drawing widespread
      attention from the general public, press and policymakers for the first
      time. This phenomenon has sharpened longstanding questions about the
      reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the
      information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer
      review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We
      assessed preprints that had been posted and subsequently published in a
      journal between 1st January and 30th April 2020, representing the initial
      phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and
      manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the
      preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure
      panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles.
      Moreover, the conclusions of 6% of non-COVID-19-related and 15% of
      COVID-19-related abstracts undergo a discrete change by the time of
      publication, but the majority of these changes do not reverse the main
      message of the paper.

    title: "Safety and Potency of COVIran Barekat Inactivated Vaccine Candidate for
      SARS-CoV-2: A Preclinical Study"
    category: immunology
    abstract: There is an urgent demand to manufacture an effective and safe vaccine
      to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection, which resulted in a global pandemic. In
      this study, we developed an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 candidate
      vaccine named COVIran Barekat. Immunization at two different doses (3
      microgram or 5 microgram per dose) elicited a high level of SARS-CoV-2
      specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and non-human primates.
      The results show the safety profile in studied animals (include guinea
      pig, rabbit, mice, and monkeys). Rhesus macaques were immunized with the
      two-dose of 5 microgram and microgram of the COVIran Barekat vaccine and
      showed highly efficient protection against 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2
      intratracheal challenge compared with the control group. These results
      highlight the COVIran Barekat vaccine as a potential candidate to induce a
      strong and potent immune response which may be a promising and feasible
      vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

    title: Heightened condition dependent expression of structural colouration in
      the faces, but not wings, of male and female flies
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Structurally coloured sexual signals are a conspicuous and widespread
      class of ornament used in mate choice, though the extent to which they
      encode information on the quality of their bearers is not fully resolved.
      Theory predicts that signalling traits under strong sexual selection as
      honest indicators should evolve to be more developmentally integrated and
      exaggerated than nonsexual traits, thereby leading to heightened condition
      dependence. Here we test this prediction through examination of the
      sexually dimorphic faces and wings of the cursorial fly Lispe cana. Males
      and females possess structural UV-white and golden faces, respectively,
      and males present their faces and wings to females during close-range,
      ground-based courtship displays, thereby creating the opportunity for
      mutual inspection. Across a field-collected sample of individuals, we
      found that the appearance of the faces of both sexes scaled positively
      with individual condition, though along separate axes. Males in better
      condition expressed brighter faces as modelled according to conspecific
      flies, whereas condition scaled with facial saturation in females. We
      found no such relationships for their wing interference pattern nor
      abdomens, with the latter included as a nonsexual control. Our results
      suggest that the structurally coloured faces, but not the iridescent
      wings, of male and female Lispe cana are reliable guides to individual
      quality and support the broader potential for structural colours as honest
      signals. They also highlight the potential for mutual mate choice in this
      system, while arguing for one of several alternate signalling roles for
      wing interferences patterns among the myriad taxa which bear them.

    title: Breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its predictors among
      healthcare workers in a medical college and hospital complex in Delhi,
      India
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: >-
      IntroductionThe study objective was to determine the breakthrough
      infection rate of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in those vaccinated with
      either BBV152 or AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) vaccine among healthcare workers
      (HCWs).


      MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was conducted a medical college and hospital complex in Delhi, India through telephonic interviews among HCWs who had received at-least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine during January to March 2021. Breakthrough infections were operationally defined as occurrence of Covid-19 infection [&ge;]14 days after administration of two doses of either Covid-19 vaccine.


      ResultsWe enrolled 326 HCWs with mean (SD) age of 29.1 (85.9) years including 212 (65%) males. Two hundred eighty (90.9%) HCWs were fully vaccinated while 46 (14.1%) were partially vaccinated. There were 168 (51.5%) BBV152 and 158 (48.5%) AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) recipients.


      A total of 36 (11%, 95% C.I. 8.1, 14.9) breakthrough infections were reported in the HCWs. The median (IQR) time until incidence of Covid-19 infection since receiving second dose of either Covid-19 vaccine was 46 (28.2, 54.7) days. Furthermore, Covid-19 infections occurred in 65 (19.9%, 95% C.I 15.9, 24.6) HCWs vaccinated with at-least one dose of vaccine but prior to receiving their second dose or <14 days post second dose. Most breakthrough infection cases (94.4%) were mild and did not require supplemental oxygen therapy. HCWs with past history of natural Covid-19 infection with recovery were 4.5 times less likely to experience a Covid-19 infection after partial vaccination.


      ConclusionNearly one in nine HCWs experienced a Covid-19 breakthrough infection in the present study.

      1. Do you know if the relative lack of severe manifestations among the
      vaccinees with breakthrough covid 19 was associated with the occurrence of
      prior Covid 19 infection before undergoing vaccination?

      2. Do you have data  on the demographics of the vaccinee recipients, especially risk factors for severe disease and age because it would be interesting to know if the vaccine truly mitigated the severity of disease or the vaccinated population is younger and healthier than most being health care workers.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    abstract: We present a comprehensive statistical framework to analyze data from
      genome-wide association studies of polygenic traits, producing distinct
      and interpretable discoveries while controlling the false discovery rate.
      This approach leverages sophisticated multivariate models, correcting for
      linkage disequilibrium, and accounts for population structure and
      relatedness, adapting to the characteristics of the samples at hand. A key
      element is the recognition that the observed genotypes can be considered
      as a random sample from an appropriate model, encapsulating our knowledge
      of genetic inheritance and human populations. This allows us to generate
      imperfect copies (knockoffs) of these variables which serve as ideal
      negative controls; knockoffs are indistinguishable from the original
      genotypes in distribution, and independent from the phenotype. In sharp
      contrast with state-of-the-art methods, the validity of our inference in
      no way depends on assumptions about the unknown relation between genotypes
      and phenotype. We develop and leverage a model for the genotypes that
      accounts for arbitrary and unknown population structure, which may be due
      to diverse ancestries or familial relatedness. We build a pipeline that is
      robust to the most prominent possible confounders, facilitating the
      discovery of causal variants. Validity and effectiveness are demonstrated
      by extensive simulations with real data, as well as by the analysis of
      several phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Finally, fast software is made
      available for researchers to apply the proposed methodology to
      Biobank-scale data sets.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      The statistical analysis is invalid suffering from an very clear immortal
      time bias. This is really basic stats 101.  There is a reason this
      pre-print has not been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal.  


      For a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, groups need to be defined at baseline.  For persons to have received >80 mg/kg cumulative HCQ dosing (where a standard 600mg dose could is ~8mg/kg/day), persons need to survive for 10 days.  So Figure 2, compares those who survive to receive 10 days of HCQ versus all others  This is an immortal time bias. 


      As 88% of people overall received HCQ, likely a large proportion of those 40% who died before day 10 received HCQ (at max only ~12% could not have received HCQ).
       
      The authors should re-do their analysis using a Cox-regression with a time-dependent covariate for receiving HCQ.

      Stephen, can you assure that not even around 7 out of the 224 patients to
      whom were given HCQ did get included in the "success" group by cumulative
      dosages (the 18 survivors that took >3g HCQ + >1g AZM) JUST BECAUSE they
      survived and therefore had more time to consolidate those dosages, and not
      the other way around?


      Because if that is the case, I believe you got a problem of statistical significance. That would leave us with just 3 survivors above general average. And by 7 out of 224, that might be the case.


      Another issue: 87% of all patients received HCQ in some form but what was the percentage of those in the survivors group? I couldn't find the number but I suspect this result is something to look at. It should be higher than 87% if any form of it works in any way. As is also something to look at the randomized double blinded studies that compare those who took HCQ+AZM to those who didn't, in a more broad way, so that we can compare the effects. I suspect that this study not being blinded or double blinded could have also skewed the results by some amount, and that is another issue.


      One more issue: I find it quite weird that you had 78% death rate when the average north american death rate for intubated patients of covid is around 46% for what I've seen. Even using a few medications that supposedly work. There must be something else at play here, probably also skewing the results.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."
