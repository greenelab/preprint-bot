    title: Immune profile of children with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2
      infection (Long Covid)
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: There is increasing reporting by patients organization and researchers
      of long covid (or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 - PASC), characterized
      by symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive and sleeping
      disturbances, arthralgia and decline in quality of life. Immune system
      dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity,
      endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as
      pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been
      reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia. However, immunological studies of
      children with PASC have never been performed. In this study, we documented
      significant immunologic differences between children that completely
      recovered from acute infection and those with PASC, providing the first
      objective laboratory sign of the existence of PASC in children.

    raw_message: Interesting paper! I have one comment though. I am noticing an
      increasing number of papers using the term post-exertional malaise (PEM)
      without providing any definition of what this condition represents. This
      is important because PEM is not a term widely known in the medical
      community and it has a distinct presentation. PEM is the worsening of a
      variety of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion and
      moreover, the severity of the impact is often delayed by hours or days and
      can take days, weeks or months to recover from. The reason why PEM is not
      widely known is because it is the cardinal symptom of the disease ME/CFS
      which has been significantly ignored and underfunded. PEM is unique to
      ME/CFS and any mention of PEM should really provide appropriate references
      to ME/CFS literature.

    abstract: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is devastating the modern
      societies worldwide, many variants that naturally acquire multiple
      mutations have emerged. Emerging mutations can affect viral properties
      such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of
      naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has recently
      been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted
      cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that two
      recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
      spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape
      from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce
      the affinity to viral receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation
      increases protein stability, viral infectivity, and potentially promotes
      viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLA-restricted cellular
      immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and the
      escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic.

    title: Multi-centre derivation and validation of a colitis-associated cancer
      risk prediction web-tool
    category: gastroenterology
    abstract: >-
      ObjectiveUlcerative colitis (UC) patients diagnosed with low-grade
      dysplasia (LGD) have increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia (AN;
      high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer). We aimed to develop and
      validate a predictor of AN risk in UC patients with LGD and create a
      visual web-tool to effectively communicate the risk.


      DesignIn our retrospective multi-centre validated cohort study, adult UC patients with an index diagnosis of LGD, identified from four UK centres between 2001-2019, were followed until progression to AN. In the discovery cohort (n=246), a multivariate risk prediction model was derived from clinicopathological features using Cox regression. Validation used data from 3 external centres (n=198). The validated model was embedded in a web-tool to calculate patient-specific risk.


      ResultsFour clinicopathological variables were significantly associated with AN progression in the discovery cohort: endoscopically visible LGD > 1 cm (HR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.2-5.9), unresectable or incomplete endoscopic resection (HR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.6-7.4), moderate/severe histological inflammation within 5 years of LGD diagnosis (HR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.7), and multifocality (HR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.2). In the validation cohort, this 4-variable model accurately predicted future AN cases with overall calibration Observed/Expected = 1 (95% CI 0.63-1.5), and achieved 100% specificity for the lowest risk group over 13 years of available follow-up.


      ConclusionMulti-cohort validation confirms that patients with large, unresected, multifocal LGD and recent moderate/severe inflammation are at highest risk of developing AN. Personalised risk prediction provided via the Ulcerative Colitis-Cancer Risk Estimator (www.UC-CaRE.uk) can support treatment decision-making.


      SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe risk of ulcerative colitis-associated low-grade dysplasia (LGD) progression to more advanced neoplasia is currently not clearly defined. The literature consists of historical data from small heterogenous observational studies with limited follow-up or lack of information on endoscopic resection status.

      C_LI


      What are the new findings?O_LIWe present the results from the largest multi-centre cohort study to evaluate LGD long-term prognosis based on clinicopathological factors that are reflective of modern surveillance techniques.

      C_LIO_LIRecent moderate or severe active inflammation or LGD that is large, not fully resectable or is multifocal remain independent predictors of advanced neoplasia progression, even when stratified to reflect the most modern era of high definition endoscopic imaging, chromoendoscopy and advanced polypectomy techniques.

      C_LIO_LIColorectal cancer incidence after endoscopic resection of unifocal polypoid and non-polypoid dysplasia is 0.6 per 100 patient-years.

      C_LIO_LILong-term incidence of advanced neoplasia is similar if LGD is invisible or if LGD is visible but not completely endoscopically resected.

      C_LIO_LIUsing these data, we have designed and externally validated a cancer risk prediction tool for ulcerative colitis patients with LGD.

      C_LI


      How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?O_LIThe UC-CaRE (Ulcerative Colitis-Cancer Risk Estimator) tool can be used to calculate and communicate individualised numerical cancer risk estimates to colitis patients with LGD.

      C_LIO_LIIt facilitates the risk stratification of the lowest-risk patients, who can be reassured by undergoing continued surveillance, and those at the highest-risk who may benefit from a prophylactic colectomy.

      C_LIO_LIThis visual aid presents the calculated risk in a graphical and pictorial form to optimise risk comprehension and informed treatment choices.

    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable clinical efficacy,
      but questions remain about the nature and kinetics of T cell priming. We
      performed longitudinal antigen-specific T cell analyses in healthy
      individuals following mRNA vaccination. Vaccination induced rapid
      near-maximal antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in all subjects after
      the first vaccine dose. CD8+ T cell responses developed gradually after
      the first and second dose and were variable. Vaccine-induced T cells had
      central memory characteristics and included both Tfh and Th1 subsets,
      similar to natural infection. Th1 and Tfh responses following the first
      dose predicted post-boost CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody levels,
      respectively. Integrated analysis of 26 antigen-specific T cell and
      humoral responses revealed coordinated features of the immune response to
      vaccination. Lastly, whereas booster vaccination improved CD4+ and CD8+ T
      cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects, the second vaccine dose had
      little effect on T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals.
      Thus, longitudinal analysis revealed robust T cell responses to mRNA
      vaccination and highlighted early induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T
      cells.

    title: "The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries
      during the COVID-19 pandemic"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or
      across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths
      can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess
      mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the
      recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the
      COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central,
      frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across
      countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or
      quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as
      the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to
      compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality
      increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by
      over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID
      mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been
      reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been
      underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more.
      Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the world's COVID-19
      death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of
      confirmed deaths.

    title: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response through
      cGAS-STING and NF-κB
    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global
      pandemic. In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild
      disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals
      develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death.
      These severe cases are often associated with high levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to
      systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine
      secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct
      upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from
      infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific
      activation of NF-κB and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in
      SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-κB response is mediated by cGAS-STING
      activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our
      results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-κB driven
      inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes
      to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to
      suppress severe disease symptoms.

    title: Leptin regulates glucose homeostasis via the canonical WNT pathway.
    category: physiology
    abstract: Leptin is a body weight regulatory hormone, but it is arguably even
      more potent at regulating blood glucose levels. To further our
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which leptin controls glucose
      homeostasis, we have used transgenic zebrafish models and conditional
      deletion of beta catenin in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice to
      show that Wnt signalling in the brain mediates glucoregulatory effects of
      leptin. In zebrafish, under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates
      glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis. In times of nutrient excess, we
      found that leptin also regulates body weight and size in this species.
      Using a Wnt signalling reporter fish, we show that leptin directly
      activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of
      this pathway prevented the leptin-induced improvement in glucose
      tolerance. In adult mice, conditional deletion of the key Wnt effector
      molecule, {beta}-catenin, in the mediobasal hypothalamus of male mice
      confirmed the essential role of the Wnt pathway in mediating leptin action
      and the neuroendocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis. Adult-onset
      {beta}-catenin deletion in the mediobasal hypothalamus led to glucose
      intolerance, exacerbation of caloric intake and body weight gain under
      high fat diet, as well as resistance to exogenous leptin.

      Hello,


      Thanks so much for an amazing paper on leptin and the canonical WNT pathway. Overall, the paper was a very interesting read, and I learned a lot about the subject area. Here are some suggestions/comments regarding the figures and experiments you performed:


      - Figure 1 does not show how pyrvinium pamoate affects the canonical WNT pathway through fluorescence intensity. Although the paper mentions that pyrvinium pamoate inhibits the pathway, it would be more effective to show this effect through the transgenic zebrafish.

      - It would be best to move Figure 1E and 1F to supplementary to create more space for the fluorescent images.

      - Figure 2 should be broken into two separate figures. This also allows you to display the results on leptin-a and leptin-b deficient zebrafish for the glucose immersion experiment. This will also give you a chance to increase the size of the graphs for better visualization.  

      - For figure 4J, explicitly mention what pre and post-treatment refer to. I know that the figure legend explains it, but it would be best to have it directly on the figure.

      - Overall, the experiments were very well conducted. I am convinced that leptin regulates glucose homeostasis through the canonical WNT pathway. Nonetheless, for the glucose immersion and overfeeding experiments, adipose tissue level should have also been measured to show that leptin does not regulate adipostasis in zebrafish.  


      Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I hope these comments can be of some help to your paper!

    title: Site-specific epigenetic marks in Trypanosoma brucei transcription
      termination, antigenic variation, and proliferation
    category: genetics
    abstract: In Trypanosoma brucei, genes assemble into polycistronic transcription
      units (PTUs). Transcription termination sites (TTSs) hold deposition sites
      for three non-essential chromatin factors, histone variants (H3v and H4v)
      and a DNA modification (base J, a hydroxyl-glucosyl dT). Here, I found
      that H4v is a major sign for transcription termination at TTSs and
      readthrough transcription machineries progress until they encounter the
      next bidirectional transcription start site. While having a secondary
      function at TTSs, H3v is important for monoallelic transcription of
      telomeric antigen genes. The simultaneous absence of both histone variants
      leads to proliferation and replication defects, which are exacerbated by
      the J deficiency, accompanied by accumulation of sub-G1 population. Base J
      likely contributes to DNA replication and cell-cycle control. I propose
      that the coordinated actions of H3v, H4v and J function in concert for
      cellular fate determination and provide compensatory mechanisms for each
      other in chromatin organization, transcription, and replication.

      Excellent work!


      I am very curious about the VSG expression patterns in your DKO and TKO cells. In Figure 6D, did you account for differences in read mappability? Since some genes have more 'unique sequence' than others, mappability may affect your RPKM.

    abstract: As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome
      sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and
      evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of variants of concern
      (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part
      of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike
      protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken
      to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current
      circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant
      clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617
      possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G
      and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding
      domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and
      681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The
      structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in
      the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in
      increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better
      transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding
      to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization
      potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera
      from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be
      studied. The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of
      convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further
      investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and
      its possibility of becoming a VOC.

    title: Opioid Prescribing Mediating State Policy Intervention Effects on Drug
      Overdose Mortality
    category: health-policy
    abstract: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 70 630 drug
      overdose deaths for 2019 in the United States, 70.5% of which were
      opioid-related. Preliminary estimates now warn that drug overdose deaths
      likely surpassed 86 000 during 2020. Despite a 57.4% decrease in opioid
      prescribing since a peak in 2012, the opioid death rate has increased
      105.8% through 2019, as the share of those deaths involving fentanyl
      increased from 16.4% to 72.9%. This letter seeks to determine whether the
      opioid prescribing and mortality paradox is robust to accepted methods of
      causal policy analysis and if prescribing rates mediate the effects of
      policy interventions on overdose deaths. Using loge-loge ordinary least
      squares with three different specifications as sensitivity analyses for
      all 50 states and Washington, DC for the period 2001-2019, the
      elasticities from the regressions with all control variables report
      operational prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce
      prescribing rates 8.7%, while mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from
      opioids 16.6%, heroin and fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs
      10.5%. There is also weak evidence that recreational marijuana laws reduce
      prescribing, increases in prescribing increase pain reliever deaths, pill
      mill laws increase cocaine deaths, and medical marijuana laws increase
      total overdose deaths, with demographic variables suggesting states with
      more male, less non-Hispanic white, and older citizens experience more
      overdoses. Weak mediation effects were observed for pain reliever,
      cocaine, and illicit opioid deaths, while broad reductions in prescribing
      have failed to reduce opioid overdoses.

      In your paper you write 



      "drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce prescribing rates 8.7%, while 

      mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from opioids 16.6%, heroin and 

      fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs 10.5%" 


      This phrasing seems to assert demonstrated cause and effect.  It is not at all clear to me that the techniques you are applying have the capability to establish that. 


      Likewise, there is an important question in this process that you do not address and I would hope you may be willing to attempt:  recognizing that predominant modes of overdose mortality involve multiple legal and illegal opioids in the great majority of deaths, is the contribution of opioids prescribed by doctors to their patients (not diverted) statistically significant  in the overall mortality rate due to all opioids, legal and illegal? Based on the relative rarity of addiction to medically managed prescription opioids,  I would suggest that it is not.

    title: Cytosolic localization and in vitro assembly of human de novo thymidylate
      synthesis complex
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: "De novo thymidylate synthesis is a crucial pathway for normal and
      cancer cells. Deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) is synthesized by the
      combined action of three enzymes: serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT),
      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS), the latter
      two targets of widely used chemotherapeutics such as antifolates and
      5-fluorouracil. These proteins translocate to the nucleus after
      SUMOylation and are suggested to assemble in this compartment into the
      thymidylate synthesis complex (dTMP-SC). We report the intracellular
      dynamics of the complex in lung cancer cells by in situ proximity ligation
      assay, showing that it is also detected in the cytoplasm. This result
      strongly indicates that the role of the dTMP-SC assembly may go beyond
      dTMP synthesis. We have successfully assembled the dTMP synthesis complex
      in vitro, employing tetrameric SHMT1 and a bifunctional chimeric enzyme
      comprising human TYMS and DHFR. We show that the SHMT1 tetrameric state is
      required for efficient complex assembly, indicating that this aggregation
      state is evolutionary selected in eukaryotes to optimize protein-protein
      interactions. Lastly, our results on the activity of the complete
      thymidylate cycle in vitro, may provide a useful tool to develop drugs
      targeting the entire complex instead of the individual components."

    title: Stability of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy and its importance
      for early infant colonization
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Early life microbiota has been linked to the development of chronic
      inflammatory diseases. It has been hypothesized that maternal vaginal
      microbiota is an important initial seeding source and therefore can have
      lifelong effects on disease risk. To understand maternal vaginal
      microbiota's role in seeding the child's microbiota and the extent of
      delivery mode-dependent transmission, we studied 700 mother-child dyads
      from the COPSAC2010 cohort. The maternal vaginal microbiota was evaluated
      in the third trimester and compared with the children's fecal and airway
      microbiota. The vaginal samples displayed known stable community state
      types and only 1:6 changed over time. Only one OTU were significantly
      transferred to children's fecal compartment, but an inflated number had
      positive transfer odds. A few taxonomic families showed early transfer
      enrichment to vaginally-born children, indicating vertical transfer, while
      half of the observed transfer effects were delivery mode independent
      enrichment with attenuating strength over time, indicating a common
      reservoir.

    abstract: Several vaccines have demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
      mediated disease, yet there is limited data on the immune response induced
      by heterologous vaccination regimens using alternate vaccine modalities.
      Here, we present a detailed description of the immune response, in mice,
      following vaccination with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine and an
      adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2.
      We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in two dose heterologous
      vaccination regimens than single dose regimens. Neutralising titres after
      heterologous prime-boost were at least comparable or higher than the
      titres measured after homologous prime boost vaccination with viral
      vectors. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous
      regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells which is
      superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in
      mice. These results underpin the need for clinical trials to investigate
      the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens with alternate vaccine
      technologies.

    title: A more accurate method for colocalisation analysis allowing for multiple
      causal variants
    category: genetics
    abstract: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) it is now common to search
      for, and find, multiple causal variants located in close proximity. It has
      also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal
      variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc,
      makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists
      for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential
      of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression
      framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use
      with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association
      at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst
      separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the
      causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate
      coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal
      variants based on conditioning or masking. We therefore recommend that
      coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of
      colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.

      Thank you for taking the time to review.  I haven't had a public review
      before to my knowledge, but they seem a thoroughly good thing.  I am not
      sure of the conventions, but hope it is in the right spirit to post a
      summary of my responses to each of your main points, which I think have
      improved the manuscript.  The changes I describe may be seen in version 2
      on biorxiv.


      1. I have adjusted coloc to use the Bayes factors that are now returned by susie_rss (thank you), so the back-calculation is no longer needed and I have removed that equation. I have also updated the relevant text to give more details on how susie_rss is called, and the number of colocalisation comparisons returned and how the pairwise probabilities of colocalisation may be interpreted.





      2. I completely agree it would be cheating to tell any method how many causal variants were simulated! I have updated the legend to figure 3, which hopefully clarifies what AA, BB etc signals are. 





      In the setting where each trait has 2 causal variants A and B, there should ideally be 4 comparisons: AA, AB, BA, BB.  Very occasionally there are more (a handful of times susie_rss reports > 2 signals).  Often there are fewer (due to power), and even when there are 4, they may not all be assignable to labelled groups and some will fall in “?”. This is why the bar height, which is proportional to the number of comparisons performed in a given category divided by the number of simulations, doesn’t reach 1.





      3. Figure 1 has now been changed to show both the change in PIP at the causal variants and at the non-causal variants. Specifically, following the approach of coloc to consider comparisons between vectors of Bayes factors corresponding to detected credible sets, I took the colSums of obj$alpha[ obj$sets$cs_index, ] as a measure of the total PIP after a run of susie_rss(). Thus the total PIP can increase/decrease by 1 if a credible set is “discovered” or “lost” after trimming.  This view of the data shows false positives are indeed introduced after trimming. This is now described at the beginning of the Results section





      Fig 3 shows, however, that despite these false positives coloc with SuSiE outperforms the alternatives, and appears to do at least as well when trimming as not. Therefore, I expanded the Discussion on trimming to give a clearer warning that while trimming is possible for coloc, these results do not support its use in fine-mapping. 





      4. Thank you for these detailed explanations. I agree it would be preferable to never trim data. I have extended the discussion to cover these points, and acknowledged your comments in helping me to do that.

    title: HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: >-
      BackgroundSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of
      severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA)
      have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to
      evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study
      using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation.


      MethodsWe analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240).


      ResultsWe identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.


      ConclusionsHLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.

    title: bootComb - An R Package to Derive Confidence Intervals for Combinations
      of Independent Parameter Estimates
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Motivation. The epidemiologist sometimes needs to combine several
      independent parameter estimates: e.g. (i) adjust an incidence rate for
      healthcare utilisation, (ii) derive a disease prevalence from the
      conditional prevalence on another condition and the prevalence of that
      condition, (iii) adjust a seroprevalence for test sensitivity and
      specificity. While obtaining the combined parameter estimate is usually
      straightforward, deriving a corresponding confidence interval often is
      not. bootComb is an R package using parametric bootstrap sampling to
      derive such confidence intervals. Implementation. bootComb is a package
      for the statistical computation environment R. General features. As well
      as a function that returns confidence intervals for parameters combined
      from several independent estimates, bootComb provides auxiliary functions
      for 6 common distributions (beta, normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson and
      negative binomial) to derive best-fit distributions (and their sampling
      functions) for parameters given their reported confidence intervals.
      Availability. bootComb is available from the Comprehensive R Archive
      Network (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bootComb)."

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative pathogen
      of the COVID-19 pandemic which as of Nov 15, 2020 has claimed 1,319,946
      lives worldwide. Vaccine development focuses on the viral trimeric spike
      glycoprotein as the main target of the humoral immune response. Viral
      spikes carry glycans that facilitate immune evasion by shielding specific
      protein epitopes from antibody neutralisation. Immunogen integrity is
      therefore important for glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates. Here we
      show how site-specific glycosylation differs between virus-derived spikes
      and spike proteins derived from a viral vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
      candidate. We show that their cellular secretion pathways are unique,
      resulting in different protein glycosylation and secretion, which may have
      implications for the resulting immune response and future vaccine design.

    title: YhcB (DUF1043), a novel cell division protein conserved across
      gamma-proteobacteria
    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      YhcB, an uncharacterized protein conserved across gamma-proteobacteria, is
      composed predominantly of a single Domain of Unknown Function (DUF 1043)
      with an N-terminal transmembrane -helix. Here, we show that E. coli YhcB
      is a conditionally essential protein that interacts with the proteins of
      the cell divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). We
      found 7 interactions of YhcB that are conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or
      Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we identified several point mutations that
      abolished interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The yhcB knock-out
      strain does not grow at 45{degrees}C and is hypersensitive to cell-wall
      acting antibiotics even in stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to
      filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septa
      development. The 2.8 [A] crystal structure for the cytosolic domain from
      Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric -helical coiled-coil
      structure that combines parallel and anti-parallel coiled-coil
      intersubunit interactions. This structure is likely to organize
      interprotein oligomeric interactions on the inner surface of the
      cytoplasmic membrane, possibly involved in regulation of cell division
      and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity in proteobacteria. In summary, YhcB
      is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that is predicted to
      play a role in cell division and consequently or in addition affects
      envelope biogenesis.


      ImportanceOnly 0.8 % of the protein annotations in the UniProt are based on experimental evidence and thus, functional characterization of unknown proteins remains a rate-limiting step in molecular biology. Herein, the functional properties of YhcB (DUF1043) were investigated using an integrated approach combining X-ray crystallography with genetics and molecular biology. YhcB is a conserved protein that appears to be needed for the transition from exponential to stationary growth and is involved in cell division and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity. This study will serve as a starting point for future studies on this protein family and on how cells transit from exponential to stationary survival.

    title: Estimated inequities in COVID-19 infection fatality rates by ethnicity
      for Aotearoa New Zealand
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: There is limited evidence as to how COVID-19 infection fatality rates
      (IFR) may vary by ethnicity. We combine demographic and health data for
      ethnic groupings in Aotearoa New Zealand with international data on IFR
      for different age groups to estimate inequities in IFR by ethnicity. We
      find that, if age is the dominant factor determining IFR, estimated IFR
      for M[a]ori is around 50% higher than non-M[a]ori. If underlying health
      conditions are more important than age per se, then estimated IFR for
      M[a]ori is more than 2.5 times that of New Zealand European, and estimated
      IFR for Pasifika is almost double that of New Zealand European. IFRs for
      M[a]ori and Pasifika are likely to be increased above these estimates by
      racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in
      official data. IFR does not account for differences among ethnicities in
      COVID-19 incidence, which could be higher in M[a]ori and Pasifika as a
      result of crowded housing and higher inter-generational contact rates.
      These factors should be included in future disease incidence modelling.
      The communities at the highest risk will be those with elderly
      populations, and M[a]ori and Pasifika communities, where the compounded
      effects of underlying health conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, and
      structural racism result in imbricated risk of contracting COVID-19,
      becoming unwell, and death.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

    raw_message: Were the patients randomized into those getting usual and those
      getting 12 week delay?  Having 99 in one group and 73 in the other does
      not seem like a random split of 172 people!  A bias toward giving
      healthier seniors the longer interval might account for some or even all
      of the results.
