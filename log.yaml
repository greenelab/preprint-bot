    title: Immune profile of children with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2
      infection (Long Covid)
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: There is increasing reporting by patients organization and researchers
      of long covid (or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 - PASC), characterized
      by symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive and sleeping
      disturbances, arthralgia and decline in quality of life. Immune system
      dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity,
      endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as
      pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been
      reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia. However, immunological studies of
      children with PASC have never been performed. In this study, we documented
      significant immunologic differences between children that completely
      recovered from acute infection and those with PASC, providing the first
      objective laboratory sign of the existence of PASC in children.

    raw_message: Interesting paper! I have one comment though. I am noticing an
      increasing number of papers using the term post-exertional malaise (PEM)
      without providing any definition of what this condition represents. This
      is important because PEM is not a term widely known in the medical
      community and it has a distinct presentation. PEM is the worsening of a
      variety of symptoms following even minor physical or mental exertion and
      moreover, the severity of the impact is often delayed by hours or days and
      can take days, weeks or months to recover from. The reason why PEM is not
      widely known is because it is the cardinal symptom of the disease ME/CFS
      which has been significantly ignored and underfunded. PEM is unique to
      ME/CFS and any mention of PEM should really provide appropriate references
      to ME/CFS literature.

    abstract: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is devastating the modern
      societies worldwide, many variants that naturally acquire multiple
      mutations have emerged. Emerging mutations can affect viral properties
      such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of
      naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has recently
      been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted
      cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that two
      recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
      spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape
      from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce
      the affinity to viral receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation
      increases protein stability, viral infectivity, and potentially promotes
      viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLA-restricted cellular
      immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and the
      escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2
      pandemic.

    title: Multi-centre derivation and validation of a colitis-associated cancer
      risk prediction web-tool
    category: gastroenterology
    abstract: >-
      ObjectiveUlcerative colitis (UC) patients diagnosed with low-grade
      dysplasia (LGD) have increased risk of developing advanced neoplasia (AN;
      high-grade dysplasia or colorectal cancer). We aimed to develop and
      validate a predictor of AN risk in UC patients with LGD and create a
      visual web-tool to effectively communicate the risk.


      DesignIn our retrospective multi-centre validated cohort study, adult UC patients with an index diagnosis of LGD, identified from four UK centres between 2001-2019, were followed until progression to AN. In the discovery cohort (n=246), a multivariate risk prediction model was derived from clinicopathological features using Cox regression. Validation used data from 3 external centres (n=198). The validated model was embedded in a web-tool to calculate patient-specific risk.


      ResultsFour clinicopathological variables were significantly associated with AN progression in the discovery cohort: endoscopically visible LGD > 1 cm (HR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.2-5.9), unresectable or incomplete endoscopic resection (HR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.6-7.4), moderate/severe histological inflammation within 5 years of LGD diagnosis (HR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.5-6.7), and multifocality (HR = 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.2). In the validation cohort, this 4-variable model accurately predicted future AN cases with overall calibration Observed/Expected = 1 (95% CI 0.63-1.5), and achieved 100% specificity for the lowest risk group over 13 years of available follow-up.


      ConclusionMulti-cohort validation confirms that patients with large, unresected, multifocal LGD and recent moderate/severe inflammation are at highest risk of developing AN. Personalised risk prediction provided via the Ulcerative Colitis-Cancer Risk Estimator (www.UC-CaRE.uk) can support treatment decision-making.


      SUMMARY BOXO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LIThe risk of ulcerative colitis-associated low-grade dysplasia (LGD) progression to more advanced neoplasia is currently not clearly defined. The literature consists of historical data from small heterogenous observational studies with limited follow-up or lack of information on endoscopic resection status.

      C_LI


      What are the new findings?O_LIWe present the results from the largest multi-centre cohort study to evaluate LGD long-term prognosis based on clinicopathological factors that are reflective of modern surveillance techniques.

      C_LIO_LIRecent moderate or severe active inflammation or LGD that is large, not fully resectable or is multifocal remain independent predictors of advanced neoplasia progression, even when stratified to reflect the most modern era of high definition endoscopic imaging, chromoendoscopy and advanced polypectomy techniques.

      C_LIO_LIColorectal cancer incidence after endoscopic resection of unifocal polypoid and non-polypoid dysplasia is 0.6 per 100 patient-years.

      C_LIO_LILong-term incidence of advanced neoplasia is similar if LGD is invisible or if LGD is visible but not completely endoscopically resected.

      C_LIO_LIUsing these data, we have designed and externally validated a cancer risk prediction tool for ulcerative colitis patients with LGD.

      C_LI


      How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?O_LIThe UC-CaRE (Ulcerative Colitis-Cancer Risk Estimator) tool can be used to calculate and communicate individualised numerical cancer risk estimates to colitis patients with LGD.

      C_LIO_LIIt facilitates the risk stratification of the lowest-risk patients, who can be reassured by undergoing continued surveillance, and those at the highest-risk who may benefit from a prophylactic colectomy.

      C_LIO_LIThis visual aid presents the calculated risk in a graphical and pictorial form to optimise risk comprehension and informed treatment choices.

    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines have shown remarkable clinical efficacy,
      but questions remain about the nature and kinetics of T cell priming. We
      performed longitudinal antigen-specific T cell analyses in healthy
      individuals following mRNA vaccination. Vaccination induced rapid
      near-maximal antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in all subjects after
      the first vaccine dose. CD8+ T cell responses developed gradually after
      the first and second dose and were variable. Vaccine-induced T cells had
      central memory characteristics and included both Tfh and Th1 subsets,
      similar to natural infection. Th1 and Tfh responses following the first
      dose predicted post-boost CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody levels,
      respectively. Integrated analysis of 26 antigen-specific T cell and
      humoral responses revealed coordinated features of the immune response to
      vaccination. Lastly, whereas booster vaccination improved CD4+ and CD8+ T
      cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 naive subjects, the second vaccine dose had
      little effect on T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals.
      Thus, longitudinal analysis revealed robust T cell responses to mRNA
      vaccination and highlighted early induction of antigen-specific CD4+ T
      cells.

    title: "The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries
      during the COVID-19 pandemic"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or
      across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths
      can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess
      mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the
      recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the
      COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central,
      frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across
      countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or
      quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as
      the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to
      compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality
      increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by
      over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID
      mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been
      reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been
      underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more.
      Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the world's COVID-19
      death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of
      confirmed deaths.

    title: SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine response through
      cGAS-STING and NF-κB
    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global
      pandemic. In the majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild
      disease; however, in a significant proportion of infections, individuals
      develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung damage or death.
      These severe cases are often associated with high levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to
      systemic complications. We have evaluated transcriptional and cytokine
      secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected a distinct
      upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from
      infected patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific
      activation of NF-κB and a block of IRF3 nuclear translocation in
      SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-κB response is mediated by cGAS-STING
      activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our
      results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-κB driven
      inflammatory immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes
      to inflammatory responses seen in patients and might be a target to
      suppress severe disease symptoms.

    title: Leptin regulates glucose homeostasis via the canonical WNT pathway.
    category: physiology
    abstract: Leptin is a body weight regulatory hormone, but it is arguably even
      more potent at regulating blood glucose levels. To further our
      understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which leptin controls glucose
      homeostasis, we have used transgenic zebrafish models and conditional
      deletion of beta catenin in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice to
      show that Wnt signalling in the brain mediates glucoregulatory effects of
      leptin. In zebrafish, under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates
      glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis. In times of nutrient excess, we
      found that leptin also regulates body weight and size in this species.
      Using a Wnt signalling reporter fish, we show that leptin directly
      activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of
      this pathway prevented the leptin-induced improvement in glucose
      tolerance. In adult mice, conditional deletion of the key Wnt effector
      molecule, {beta}-catenin, in the mediobasal hypothalamus of male mice
      confirmed the essential role of the Wnt pathway in mediating leptin action
      and the neuroendocrine regulation of glucose homeostasis. Adult-onset
      {beta}-catenin deletion in the mediobasal hypothalamus led to glucose
      intolerance, exacerbation of caloric intake and body weight gain under
      high fat diet, as well as resistance to exogenous leptin.

      Hello,


      Thanks so much for an amazing paper on leptin and the canonical WNT pathway. Overall, the paper was a very interesting read, and I learned a lot about the subject area. Here are some suggestions/comments regarding the figures and experiments you performed:


      - Figure 1 does not show how pyrvinium pamoate affects the canonical WNT pathway through fluorescence intensity. Although the paper mentions that pyrvinium pamoate inhibits the pathway, it would be more effective to show this effect through the transgenic zebrafish.

      - It would be best to move Figure 1E and 1F to supplementary to create more space for the fluorescent images.

      - Figure 2 should be broken into two separate figures. This also allows you to display the results on leptin-a and leptin-b deficient zebrafish for the glucose immersion experiment. This will also give you a chance to increase the size of the graphs for better visualization.  

      - For figure 4J, explicitly mention what pre and post-treatment refer to. I know that the figure legend explains it, but it would be best to have it directly on the figure.

      - Overall, the experiments were very well conducted. I am convinced that leptin regulates glucose homeostasis through the canonical WNT pathway. Nonetheless, for the glucose immersion and overfeeding experiments, adipose tissue level should have also been measured to show that leptin does not regulate adipostasis in zebrafish.  


      Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. I hope these comments can be of some help to your paper!

    title: Site-specific epigenetic marks in Trypanosoma brucei transcription
      termination, antigenic variation, and proliferation
    category: genetics
    abstract: In Trypanosoma brucei, genes assemble into polycistronic transcription
      units (PTUs). Transcription termination sites (TTSs) hold deposition sites
      for three non-essential chromatin factors, histone variants (H3v and H4v)
      and a DNA modification (base J, a hydroxyl-glucosyl dT). Here, I found
      that H4v is a major sign for transcription termination at TTSs and
      readthrough transcription machineries progress until they encounter the
      next bidirectional transcription start site. While having a secondary
      function at TTSs, H3v is important for monoallelic transcription of
      telomeric antigen genes. The simultaneous absence of both histone variants
      leads to proliferation and replication defects, which are exacerbated by
      the J deficiency, accompanied by accumulation of sub-G1 population. Base J
      likely contributes to DNA replication and cell-cycle control. I propose
      that the coordinated actions of H3v, H4v and J function in concert for
      cellular fate determination and provide compensatory mechanisms for each
      other in chromatin organization, transcription, and replication.

      Excellent work!


      I am very curious about the VSG expression patterns in your DKO and TKO cells. In Figure 6D, did you account for differences in read mappability? Since some genes have more 'unique sequence' than others, mappability may affect your RPKM.

    abstract: As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome
      sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and
      evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of variants of concern
      (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part
      of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike
      protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken
      to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current
      circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant
      clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617
      possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G
      and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding
      domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and
      681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The
      structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in
      the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in
      increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better
      transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding
      to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization
      potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera
      from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be
      studied. The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of
      convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further
      investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and
      its possibility of becoming a VOC.

    title: Opioid Prescribing Mediating State Policy Intervention Effects on Drug
      Overdose Mortality
    category: health-policy
    abstract: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 70 630 drug
      overdose deaths for 2019 in the United States, 70.5% of which were
      opioid-related. Preliminary estimates now warn that drug overdose deaths
      likely surpassed 86 000 during 2020. Despite a 57.4% decrease in opioid
      prescribing since a peak in 2012, the opioid death rate has increased
      105.8% through 2019, as the share of those deaths involving fentanyl
      increased from 16.4% to 72.9%. This letter seeks to determine whether the
      opioid prescribing and mortality paradox is robust to accepted methods of
      causal policy analysis and if prescribing rates mediate the effects of
      policy interventions on overdose deaths. Using loge-loge ordinary least
      squares with three different specifications as sensitivity analyses for
      all 50 states and Washington, DC for the period 2001-2019, the
      elasticities from the regressions with all control variables report
      operational prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce
      prescribing rates 8.7%, while mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from
      opioids 16.6%, heroin and fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs
      10.5%. There is also weak evidence that recreational marijuana laws reduce
      prescribing, increases in prescribing increase pain reliever deaths, pill
      mill laws increase cocaine deaths, and medical marijuana laws increase
      total overdose deaths, with demographic variables suggesting states with
      more male, less non-Hispanic white, and older citizens experience more
      overdoses. Weak mediation effects were observed for pain reliever,
      cocaine, and illicit opioid deaths, while broad reductions in prescribing
      have failed to reduce opioid overdoses.

      In your paper you write 



      "drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) reduce prescribing rates 8.7%, while 

      mandatory PDMPs increase death rates from opioids 16.6%, heroin and 

      fentanyl 19.0%, cocaine 17.3% and all drugs 10.5%" 


      This phrasing seems to assert demonstrated cause and effect.  It is not at all clear to me that the techniques you are applying have the capability to establish that. 


      Likewise, there is an important question in this process that you do not address and I would hope you may be willing to attempt:  recognizing that predominant modes of overdose mortality involve multiple legal and illegal opioids in the great majority of deaths, is the contribution of opioids prescribed by doctors to their patients (not diverted) statistically significant  in the overall mortality rate due to all opioids, legal and illegal? Based on the relative rarity of addiction to medically managed prescription opioids,  I would suggest that it is not.

    title: Cytosolic localization and in vitro assembly of human de novo thymidylate
      synthesis complex
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: "De novo thymidylate synthesis is a crucial pathway for normal and
      cancer cells. Deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) is synthesized by the
      combined action of three enzymes: serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT),
      dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS), the latter
      two targets of widely used chemotherapeutics such as antifolates and
      5-fluorouracil. These proteins translocate to the nucleus after
      SUMOylation and are suggested to assemble in this compartment into the
      thymidylate synthesis complex (dTMP-SC). We report the intracellular
      dynamics of the complex in lung cancer cells by in situ proximity ligation
      assay, showing that it is also detected in the cytoplasm. This result
      strongly indicates that the role of the dTMP-SC assembly may go beyond
      dTMP synthesis. We have successfully assembled the dTMP synthesis complex
      in vitro, employing tetrameric SHMT1 and a bifunctional chimeric enzyme
      comprising human TYMS and DHFR. We show that the SHMT1 tetrameric state is
      required for efficient complex assembly, indicating that this aggregation
      state is evolutionary selected in eukaryotes to optimize protein-protein
      interactions. Lastly, our results on the activity of the complete
      thymidylate cycle in vitro, may provide a useful tool to develop drugs
      targeting the entire complex instead of the individual components."

    title: Stability of the vaginal microbiota during pregnancy and its importance
      for early infant colonization
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Early life microbiota has been linked to the development of chronic
      inflammatory diseases. It has been hypothesized that maternal vaginal
      microbiota is an important initial seeding source and therefore can have
      lifelong effects on disease risk. To understand maternal vaginal
      microbiota's role in seeding the child's microbiota and the extent of
      delivery mode-dependent transmission, we studied 700 mother-child dyads
      from the COPSAC2010 cohort. The maternal vaginal microbiota was evaluated
      in the third trimester and compared with the children's fecal and airway
      microbiota. The vaginal samples displayed known stable community state
      types and only 1:6 changed over time. Only one OTU were significantly
      transferred to children's fecal compartment, but an inflated number had
      positive transfer odds. A few taxonomic families showed early transfer
      enrichment to vaginally-born children, indicating vertical transfer, while
      half of the observed transfer effects were delivery mode independent
      enrichment with attenuating strength over time, indicating a common
      reservoir.

    abstract: Several vaccines have demonstrated efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
      mediated disease, yet there is limited data on the immune response induced
      by heterologous vaccination regimens using alternate vaccine modalities.
      Here, we present a detailed description of the immune response, in mice,
      following vaccination with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine and an
      adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2.
      We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in two dose heterologous
      vaccination regimens than single dose regimens. Neutralising titres after
      heterologous prime-boost were at least comparable or higher than the
      titres measured after homologous prime boost vaccination with viral
      vectors. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous
      regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells which is
      superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in
      mice. These results underpin the need for clinical trials to investigate
      the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens with alternate vaccine
      technologies.

    title: A more accurate method for colocalisation analysis allowing for multiple
      causal variants
    category: genetics
    abstract: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) it is now common to search
      for, and find, multiple causal variants located in close proximity. It has
      also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal
      variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc,
      makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists
      for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential
      of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression
      framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use
      with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association
      at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst
      separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the
      causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate
      coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal
      variants based on conditioning or masking. We therefore recommend that
      coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of
      colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.

      Thank you for taking the time to review.  I haven't had a public review
      before to my knowledge, but they seem a thoroughly good thing.  I am not
      sure of the conventions, but hope it is in the right spirit to post a
      summary of my responses to each of your main points, which I think have
      improved the manuscript.  The changes I describe may be seen in version 2
      on biorxiv.


      1. I have adjusted coloc to use the Bayes factors that are now returned by susie_rss (thank you), so the back-calculation is no longer needed and I have removed that equation. I have also updated the relevant text to give more details on how susie_rss is called, and the number of colocalisation comparisons returned and how the pairwise probabilities of colocalisation may be interpreted.





      2. I completely agree it would be cheating to tell any method how many causal variants were simulated! I have updated the legend to figure 3, which hopefully clarifies what AA, BB etc signals are. 





      In the setting where each trait has 2 causal variants A and B, there should ideally be 4 comparisons: AA, AB, BA, BB.  Very occasionally there are more (a handful of times susie_rss reports > 2 signals).  Often there are fewer (due to power), and even when there are 4, they may not all be assignable to labelled groups and some will fall in “?”. This is why the bar height, which is proportional to the number of comparisons performed in a given category divided by the number of simulations, doesn’t reach 1.





      3. Figure 1 has now been changed to show both the change in PIP at the causal variants and at the non-causal variants. Specifically, following the approach of coloc to consider comparisons between vectors of Bayes factors corresponding to detected credible sets, I took the colSums of obj$alpha[ obj$sets$cs_index, ] as a measure of the total PIP after a run of susie_rss(). Thus the total PIP can increase/decrease by 1 if a credible set is “discovered” or “lost” after trimming.  This view of the data shows false positives are indeed introduced after trimming. This is now described at the beginning of the Results section





      Fig 3 shows, however, that despite these false positives coloc with SuSiE outperforms the alternatives, and appears to do at least as well when trimming as not. Therefore, I expanded the Discussion on trimming to give a clearer warning that while trimming is possible for coloc, these results do not support its use in fine-mapping. 





      4. Thank you for these detailed explanations. I agree it would be preferable to never trim data. I have extended the discussion to cover these points, and acknowledged your comments in helping me to do that.

    title: HLA-C* 04:01 is a Genetic Risk Allele for Severe Course of COVID-19
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: >-
      BackgroundSince the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      pandemic, there has been increasing demand to identify predictors of
      severe clinical course in patients infected with severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Human leukocyte antigen alleles (HLA)
      have been suggested as potential genetic host factors. We sought to
      evaluate this hypothesis by conducting an international multicenter study
      using HLA sequencing with subsequent independent validation.


      MethodsWe analyzed a total of 332 samples. First, we enrolled 233 patients in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for HLA and whole exome sequencing. Furthermore, we validated our results in a public data set (United States, n=99). Patients older than 18 years presenting with COVID-19 were included, representing the full spectrum of the disease. HLA candidate alleles were identified in the derivation cohort (n=92) and tested in two independent validation cohorts (n=240).


      ResultsWe identified HLA-C* 04:01 as a novel genetic predictor for severe clinical course in COVID-19. Carriers of HLA-C* 04:01 had twice the risk of intubation when infected with SARS-CoV-2 (hazard ratio 2.1, adjusted p-value=0.0036). Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in an independent data set. Furthermore, our findings are biologically plausible, as HLA-C* 04:01 has fewer predicted bindings sites with relevant SARS-CoV-2 peptides as compared to other HLA alleles. Exome sequencing confirmed findings from HLA analysis.


      ConclusionsHLA-C* 04:01 carriage is associated with a twofold increased risk of intubation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for HLA-C* 04:01 could have clinical implications to identify high-risk patients and individualize management.

    title: bootComb - An R Package to Derive Confidence Intervals for Combinations
      of Independent Parameter Estimates
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Motivation. The epidemiologist sometimes needs to combine several
      independent parameter estimates: e.g. (i) adjust an incidence rate for
      healthcare utilisation, (ii) derive a disease prevalence from the
      conditional prevalence on another condition and the prevalence of that
      condition, (iii) adjust a seroprevalence for test sensitivity and
      specificity. While obtaining the combined parameter estimate is usually
      straightforward, deriving a corresponding confidence interval often is
      not. bootComb is an R package using parametric bootstrap sampling to
      derive such confidence intervals. Implementation. bootComb is a package
      for the statistical computation environment R. General features. As well
      as a function that returns confidence intervals for parameters combined
      from several independent estimates, bootComb provides auxiliary functions
      for 6 common distributions (beta, normal, exponential, gamma, Poisson and
      negative binomial) to derive best-fit distributions (and their sampling
      functions) for parameters given their reported confidence intervals.
      Availability. bootComb is available from the Comprehensive R Archive
      Network (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bootComb)."

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative pathogen
      of the COVID-19 pandemic which as of Nov 15, 2020 has claimed 1,319,946
      lives worldwide. Vaccine development focuses on the viral trimeric spike
      glycoprotein as the main target of the humoral immune response. Viral
      spikes carry glycans that facilitate immune evasion by shielding specific
      protein epitopes from antibody neutralisation. Immunogen integrity is
      therefore important for glycoprotein-based vaccine candidates. Here we
      show how site-specific glycosylation differs between virus-derived spikes
      and spike proteins derived from a viral vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
      candidate. We show that their cellular secretion pathways are unique,
      resulting in different protein glycosylation and secretion, which may have
      implications for the resulting immune response and future vaccine design.

    title: YhcB (DUF1043), a novel cell division protein conserved across
      gamma-proteobacteria
    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      YhcB, an uncharacterized protein conserved across gamma-proteobacteria, is
      composed predominantly of a single Domain of Unknown Function (DUF 1043)
      with an N-terminal transmembrane -helix. Here, we show that E. coli YhcB
      is a conditionally essential protein that interacts with the proteins of
      the cell divisome (e.g., FtsI, FtsQ) and elongasome (e.g., RodZ, RodA). We
      found 7 interactions of YhcB that are conserved in Yersinia pestis and/or
      Vibrio cholerae. Furthermore, we identified several point mutations that
      abolished interactions of YhcB with FtsI and RodZ. The yhcB knock-out
      strain does not grow at 45{degrees}C and is hypersensitive to cell-wall
      acting antibiotics even in stationary phase. The deletion of yhcB leads to
      filamentation, abnormal FtsZ ring formation, and aberrant septa
      development. The 2.8 [A] crystal structure for the cytosolic domain from
      Haemophilus ducreyi YhcB shows a unique tetrameric -helical coiled-coil
      structure that combines parallel and anti-parallel coiled-coil
      intersubunit interactions. This structure is likely to organize
      interprotein oligomeric interactions on the inner surface of the
      cytoplasmic membrane, possibly involved in regulation of cell division
      and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity in proteobacteria. In summary, YhcB
      is a conserved and conditionally essential protein that is predicted to
      play a role in cell division and consequently or in addition affects
      envelope biogenesis.


      ImportanceOnly 0.8 % of the protein annotations in the UniProt are based on experimental evidence and thus, functional characterization of unknown proteins remains a rate-limiting step in molecular biology. Herein, the functional properties of YhcB (DUF1043) were investigated using an integrated approach combining X-ray crystallography with genetics and molecular biology. YhcB is a conserved protein that appears to be needed for the transition from exponential to stationary growth and is involved in cell division and/or envelope biogenesis/integrity. This study will serve as a starting point for future studies on this protein family and on how cells transit from exponential to stationary survival.

    title: Estimated inequities in COVID-19 infection fatality rates by ethnicity
      for Aotearoa New Zealand
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: There is limited evidence as to how COVID-19 infection fatality rates
      (IFR) may vary by ethnicity. We combine demographic and health data for
      ethnic groupings in Aotearoa New Zealand with international data on IFR
      for different age groups to estimate inequities in IFR by ethnicity. We
      find that, if age is the dominant factor determining IFR, estimated IFR
      for M[a]ori is around 50% higher than non-M[a]ori. If underlying health
      conditions are more important than age per se, then estimated IFR for
      M[a]ori is more than 2.5 times that of New Zealand European, and estimated
      IFR for Pasifika is almost double that of New Zealand European. IFRs for
      M[a]ori and Pasifika are likely to be increased above these estimates by
      racism within the healthcare system and other inequities not reflected in
      official data. IFR does not account for differences among ethnicities in
      COVID-19 incidence, which could be higher in M[a]ori and Pasifika as a
      result of crowded housing and higher inter-generational contact rates.
      These factors should be included in future disease incidence modelling.
      The communities at the highest risk will be those with elderly
      populations, and M[a]ori and Pasifika communities, where the compounded
      effects of underlying health conditions, socioeconomic disadvantage, and
      structural racism result in imbricated risk of contracting COVID-19,
      becoming unwell, and death.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

    raw_message: Were the patients randomized into those getting usual and those
      getting 12 week delay?  Having 99 in one group and 73 in the other does
      not seem like a random split of 172 people!  A bias toward giving
      healthier seniors the longer interval might account for some or even all
      of the results.

    title: "Whole-ExM: Expansion microscopy imaging of all anatomical structures of
      whole larval zebrafish"
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: Nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures over whole vertebrates
      is needed for a systematic understanding of human diseases, but this has
      not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate whole-ExM, which enables
      nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures of whole zebrafish larvae
      by labeling the proteins of the larvae with fluorophores and expanding
      them four-fold. We first optimize the fluorophore selection and labeling
      procedure to visualize a broader range of anatomical structures. We then
      develop an expansion protocol for zebrafish larvae having calcified body
      parts. Through this process, we visualize the nanoscale details of diverse
      larvae organs, which have corresponding organ counterparts in humans, over
      the intact larvae. We show that whole-ExM retains the fluorescence signals
      of fluorescent proteins, and its resolution is high enough to visualize
      various structures that can be imaged only with electron microscopy.
      Whole-ExM would enable the nanoscale study of the molecular mechanisms of
      human diseases.

      Congratulations on this beautiful work.


      The ‘unknown structures' that you have imaged in the olfactory epithelium and skin in Suppl. Fig. 32 are rodlet cells, which have been described in several previous papers, including in the zebrafish.  See: 

      Hansen and Zeiske (1998) The Peripheral Olfactory Organ of the Zebrafish, Danio rerio: an Ultrastructural Study.  Chem. Senses 23: 39-48

      DePasquale, J. A. (2020). Tropomyosin and alpha-actinin in teleost rodlet cells. Acta Zool. 00, 1–10. doi: 10.1111/azo.12344


      We included some discussion on rodlet cells in our recent paper on a different cell type, olfactory rod cells, which have a single actin-rich projection (and are also visible in your Suppl. Video 14).  See Cheung et al. (2021).  Olfactory Rod Cells: A Rare Cell Type in the Larval Zebrafish Olfactory Epithelium With a Large Actin-Rich Apical Projection.

    abstract: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens efforts to contain the
      COVID-19 pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has
      risen steeply in recent weeks and a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is
      believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of
      B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which
      interacts with the ACE2 receptor and constitutes the main target of
      neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyzed whether B.1.617 is more
      adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 entered
      two out of eight cell lines tested with slightly increased efficiency and
      was blocked by entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 was resistant
      against Bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. Finally,
      B.1.617 evaded antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although
      with moderate efficiency. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody
      evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.

    title: Wisconsin April 2020 Election Not Associated with Increase in COVID-19
      Infection Rates
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Background: Wisconsin (WI) held a primary election in the midst of
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Live voting at polls was allowed despite concern
      over increasing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to 1.1 million
      absentee ballots cast, 453,222 persons voted live. The purpose of our
      study was to determine if an increase in COVID-19 activity was associated
      with the election. Methods: Using the voting age population for the United
      States (US), WI, and its 3 largest counties, and daily new COVID-19 case
      reports from various COVID-19 web-based dashboards, daily new case rates
      were calculated. With election day April 7, the incubation period included
      April 12-21. The new case activity in the rest of the US was compared with
      the Wisconsin activity during the incubation period. Results: WI daily new
      case rates were lower than those of the rest of the US for the 10-day
      period before the election and remained lower during the post exposure
      incubation period. The ratio of Wisconsin new case rates to US new case
      rates was 0.34 WI: 1 US for the 10 days leading up to the election and
      declined to 0.28 WI: 1 US for the 10-day post-incubation period after the
      election. Similar analysis for Milwaukee county showed a pre-election
      ratio of 1.02 Milwaukee: 1 US and after the election the ratio was 0.63
      Milwaukee: 1 US. Dane county had a pre-election ratio of 0.21 Dane: 1 US
      case, and it fell to 0.13 Dane: 1 US after the election. Waukesha county
      had a pre-election ratio of 0.27 Waukesha: 1 US case and that fell to 0.19
      Waukesha: 1 US after the election. Conclusions: There was no increase in
      COVID-19 new case daily rates observed for Wisconsin or its 3 largest
      counties following the election on April 7, 2020, as compared to the US,
      during the post-incubation interval period."

    title: Metric and chronological time in human episodic memory
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: >-
      The relative contributions of metric and chronological time in the
      encoding of episodic memories are unknown. One hundred one healthy young
      adults viewed 48 unique episodes of visual events and were later tested on
      recall of the order of events (chronological time) and the precise timing
      of events (metric time). The behavioral results show that metric recall
      accuracy correlates with chronological accuracy for events within
      episodes, but does not play a role on larger time-scales across episodes.
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding and recall showed
      that metric time was represented in the posterior medial entorhinal
      cortex, as well as the temporal pole and the cerebellum, whereas
      chronological time was represented in a widespread brain network including
      the anterior lateral entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal
      cortex and the prefrontal cortex. We conclude that metric time has a role
      in episodic memory on short time-scales and is mainly subserved by medial
      temporal lobe structures.

    title: Invasive garlic mustard demonstrates stronger relationships with
      pathotrophic than mycorrhizal fungi
    category: ecology
    abstract: Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) has long been known to degrade
      mycorrhizal mutualisms in soils it invades and may also promote the
      abundance of microbial pathogens harmful to native plants or alter
      saprotrophic communities to disrupt nutrient cycling. Phenology of other
      invasive species, like Lepidium latifolium and Lonicera maackii, plays a
      role in their interactions with soil microbial communities, and so we may
      expect garlic mustard phenology to influence its effects on native soil
      microbiomes as well. Here, we investigate differences in fungal,
      bacterial, and archaeal community structure, as well as the abundance of
      key functional groups, between garlic mustard present, absent, and removed
      treatments in central-Illinois forest soils across different stages of the
      garlic mustard life cycle. Across its phenology, garlic mustard present
      soils had different overall fungal community structure and greater
      abundance of pathotrophic fungi than soils where garlic mustard was absent
      or removed. However, abundance of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi
      as well as bacterial and archaeal community structure were similar between
      treatments and did not interact with garlic mustard phenology. The most
      abundant overall fungal taxon was a plant pathogen, Entorrhiza
      aschersoniana, that was greatest in garlic mustard present soils,
      particularly while the plants were flowering. These results support the
      hypothesis that invasive plants form active relationships with microbial
      pathogens that could contribute to their overall success in invading
      ecosystems.

      Talaromyces marneffei is (we hope!) unlikely to be a common fungus in
      Illinois soils. It is a serious human pathogen that is, so far as we know,
      restricted to southeast Asia, centered on Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Some
      other IDs are equally suspect. Please don't let this get into print.

    abstract: The 2019 outbreak of a severe respiratory disease caused by an
      emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread globally with high morbidity
      and mortality. Co-circulating seasonal influenza has greatly diminished
      recently, but expected to return with novel strains emerging, thus
      requiring annual strain adjustments. We have developed a recombinant
      hemagglutinin (HA) quadrivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (qNIV)
      produced using an established recombinant insect cell expression system to
      produce nanoparticles. Influenza qNIV adjuvanted with Matrix-M was
      well-tolerated and induced robust antibody and cellular responses, notably
      against both homologous and drifted A/H3N2 viruses in Phase 1, 2, and 3
      trials. We also developed a full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccine
      stable in the prefusion conformation (NVX-CoV2373) using the same platform
      technology. In phase 3 clinical trials, NVX-CoV2373 is highly immunogenic
      and protective against the prototype strain and B.1.1.7 variant. Here we
      describe the immunogenicity and efficacy of a combination quadrivalent
      seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccine (qNIV/CoV2373). In ferret and hamster
      models, qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine produces high titer influenza
      hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) and neutralizing antibodies against
      influenza A and B strains. The combination vaccine also elicited
      antibodies that block SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the human
      angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor. Significantly, hamsters
      immunized with qNIV/CoV2373 vaccine and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 were
      protected against weight loss and were free of replicating SARS-CoV-2 in
      the upper and lower respiratory tract with no evidence of viral pneumonia.
      This study supports evaluation of qNIV/CoV2373 combination vaccine as a
      preventive measure for seasonal influenza and CoVID-19.

    title: Plants emit informative airborne sounds under stress
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: Stressed plants show altered phenotypes, including changes in color,
      smell, and shape. Yet, the possibility that plants emit airborne sounds
      when stressed – similarly to many animals – has not been investigated.
      Here we show, to our knowledge for the first time, that stressed plants
      emit airborne sounds that can be recorded remotely, both in acoustic
      chambers and in greenhouses. We recorded ∼65 dBSPL ultrasonic sounds 10 cm
      from tomato and tobacco plants, implying that these sounds could be
      detected by some organisms from up to several meters away. We developed
      machine learning models that were capable of distinguishing between plant
      sounds and general noises, and identifying the condition of the plants –
      dry, cut, or intact – based solely on the emitted sounds. Our results
      suggest that animals, humans, and possibly even other plants, could use
      sounds emitted by a plant to gain information about the plant’s condition.
      More investigation on plant bioacoustics in general and on sound emission
      in plants in particular may open new avenues for understanding plants and
      their interactions with the environment, and it may also have a
      significant impact on agriculture.

    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: Nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures over whole vertebrates
      is needed for a systematic understanding of human diseases, but this has
      not yet been achieved. Here, we demonstrate whole-ExM, which enables
      nanoscale imaging of all anatomical structures of whole zebrafish larvae
      by labeling the proteins of the larvae with fluorophores and expanding
      them four-fold. We first optimize the fluorophore selection and labeling
      procedure to visualize a broader range of anatomical structures. We then
      develop an expansion protocol for zebrafish larvae having calcified body
      parts. Through this process, we visualize the nanoscale details of diverse
      larvae organs, which have corresponding organ counterparts in humans, over
      the intact larvae. We show that whole-ExM retains the fluorescence signals
      of fluorescent proteins, and its resolution is high enough to visualize
      various structures that can be imaged only with electron microscopy.
      Whole-ExM would enable the nanoscale study of the molecular mechanisms of
      human diseases.

    title: A stochastic model for COVID-19 spread and the effects of Alert Level 4
      in Aotearoa New Zealand
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: While case numbers remain low, population-wide control methods
      combined with efficient tracing, testing, and case isolation, offer the
      opportunity for New Zealand to contain and eliminate COVID-19. We use a
      stochastic model to investigate containment and elimination scenarios for
      COVID-19 in New Zealand, as the country considers the exit from its four
      week period of strong Level 4 population-wide control measures. In
      particular we consider how the effectiveness of its case isolation
      operations influence the outcome of lifting these strong population-wide
      controls. The model is parameterised for New Zealand and is initialised
      using current case data, although we do not make use of information
      concerning the geographic dispersion of cases and the model is not
      stratified for age or co-morbidities. We find that fast tracing and case
      isolation (i.e. operations that are sustained at rates comparable to that
      at the early stages of New Zealand's response) can lead to containment or
      elimination, as long as strong population-wide controls remain in place.
      Slow case isolation can lead to containment (but not elimination) as long
      as strong Level 4 population-wide controls remain in place. However, we
      find that relaxing strong population-wide controls after four weeks will
      most likely lead to a further outbreak, although the speed of growth of
      this outbreak can be reduced by fast case isolation, by tracing, testing,
      or otherwise. We find that elimination is only likely if case isolation is
      combined with strong population-wide controls that are maintained for
      longer than four weeks. Further versions of this model will include an
      age-structured population as well as considering the effects of geographic
      dispersion and contact network structure, the possibility of regional
      containment combined with inter-regional travel restrictions, and the
      potential for harm to at risk communities and essential workers.

    title: "Efficacy of Sofosbuvir plus Ledipasvir in Egyptian patients with
      COVID-19 compared to standard treatment: Randomized controlled trial"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: COVID-19 is a pandemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2,
      which is an RNA virus similar to HCV in the replication process.
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is an approved drug by the FDA to treat HCV
      infection. This study investigates the efficacy of Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir
      as a treatment for patients with moderate COVID-19 infection.. Methods:
      This is a single-blinded parallel-randomized controlled trial. The
      participants were randomized equally into the intervention group received
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (S.L. group), and the control group received
      Oseltamivir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Azithromycin (OCH group). The primary
      outcomes were the cure rate over time and the incidence of serious adverse
      events. The secondary outcomes included the laboratory findings. Results:
      Two hundred and fifty patients were divided equally into each group. Both
      groups were similar regarding gender, but age was higher in the S.L. group
      (p=0.001). In the S.L. group, 89 (71.2%) patients were cured, while only
      51 (40.8%) patients were cured in the OCH group. The cure rate was
      significantly higher in the S.L. group (RR=1.75, p<0.001). Kaplan-Meir
      plot showed a considerably higher cure over time in the S.L. group
      (Log-rank test, p=0.032). There were no deaths in the S.L. group, but
      there were six deaths (4.8%) in the OCH group (RR=0.08, p=0.013). Seven
      patients (5.6%) in the S.L. group and six patients (4.8%) in the OCH group
      were admitted to ICU (RR=1.17, P=0.776). There was no significant
      difference between treatment groups regarding Total Leukocyte Count,
      Neutrophils count, Lymph, Alanine transaminase, and Urea. Conclusion:
      Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir is suggestive of being effective in treating
      patients with moderate COVID-19 infection. Further studies are needed to
      compare Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir with the new treatment protocols."

    title: The plasmablast response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is dominated by
      non-neutralizing antibodies that target both the NTD and the RBD
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: In this study we profiled vaccine-induced polyclonal antibodies as
      well as plasmablast derived mAbs from subjects who received SARS-CoV-2
      spike mRNA vaccine. Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust
      and comparable to or exceeded those seen after natural infection. However,
      that the ratio of binding to neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was
      greater than that after natural infection and, at the monoclonal level, we
      found that the majority of vaccine-induced antibodies did not have
      neutralizing activity. We also found a co-dominance of mAbs targeting the
      NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original antigenic-sin like
      backboost to seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins.
      Neutralizing activity of NTD mAbs but not RBD mAbs against a clinical
      viral isolate carrying E484K as well as extensive changes in the NTD was
      abolished, suggesting that a proportion of vaccine induced RBD binding
      antibodies may provide substantial protection against viral variants
      carrying E484K.

    title: Practical Indicators for Risk of Airborne Transmission in Shared Indoor
      Environments and their application to COVID-19 Outbreaks
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Some infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can be transmitted via
      aerosols that are emitted by an infectious person and inhaled by
      susceptible individuals. Although physical distancing effectively reduces
      short-range airborne transmission, many infections have occurred when
      sharing room air despite maintaining distancing. We propose two simple
      parameters as indicators of infection risk for this situation. They
      combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission
      indoors: virus-containing aerosol generation rate, breathing flow rate,
      masking and its quality, ventilation and air cleaning rates, number of
      occupants, and duration of exposure. COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend
      in relation to these parameters that is consistent with an airborne
      infection model, supporting the importance of airborne transmission for
      these outbreaks. The observed trends of outbreak size vs. risk parameters
      allow us to recommend values of the parameters to minimize COVID-19 indoor
      infection risk. All of the pre-pandemic spaces are in a regime where they
      are highly sensitive to mitigation efforts. Measles outbreaks occur at
      much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19, while tuberculosis
      outbreaks are observed at much higher risk parameter values. Since both
      diseases are accepted as airborne, the fact that COVID-19 is less
      contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission. It is
      important that future outbreak reports include ventilation information, to
      allow expanding our knowledge of the circumstances conducive to airborne
      transmission of different diseases."

      I mailed the author for correspondence constructively two weeks ago but I have had no reply. 


      I am a professor of computer science. The Excel spreadsheet is, sadly, appalling and needs a lot of professional work to be believable. There is no useful documentation about how it is intended to work. It is obscure and impossible to check. I doubt it is correct, unless evidence can be provided. In short, the results described in this paper cannot be relied on or used for any public health purposes.


      Have any of the authors carefully reviewed the spreadsheet? Any independent parties? If so I think the paper should say so.


      Best wishes, though, with this important work.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

    abstract: Several variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging across the globe,
      continuing to threaten the efforts to end COVID-19 pandemic. Recent data
      indicate the prevalence of variants with N440K Spike substitution in
      several parts of India, which is under the second wave of the pandemic.
      Here, we first analyze the prevalence of N440K variants within the
      sequences submitted from India and identify a rising trend of its spread
      across various clusters. We then compare the replicative fitness and
      infectivity of a prototype of this variant with two other previously
      prevalent strains. The N440K variant produced ten times higher infectious
      viral titers than a prevalent A2a strain, and over 1000 folds higher
      titers than a much less prevalent A3i strain prototype in Caco2 cells.
      Similar results were detected in Calu-3 cells as well, confirming the
      increased potency of the N440K variant. Interestingly, A3i strain showed
      the highest viral RNA levels, but the lowest infectious titers in the
      culture supernatants, indicating the absence of correlation between the
      RNA content and the infectivity of the sample. N440K mutation has been
      reported in several viral sequences across India and based on our results,
      we predict that the higher infectious titers achieved by this strain could
      possibly lead to its higher rate of transmission. Availability of more
      sequencing data in the immediate future would help understand the
      potential spread of this variant in more detail.

    title: Muscle Van Gogh-like 2 shapes the neuromuscular synapse by regulating
      MuSK signaling activity
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: The development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) requires dynamic
      trans-synaptic coordination orchestrated by secreted factors, including
      the morphogens of the Wnt family. Yet, how the signal of these synaptic
      cues is transduced, and particularly during the regulation of
      acetylcholine receptor (AChR) accumulation in the postsynaptic membrane
      remains unclear. We explored the function of Van Gogh-Like protein 2
      (Vangl2), a core component of Wnt planar cell polarity signaling. We
      showed that the conditional genetic ablation of Vangl2 in muscle
      reproduces the NMJ differentiation defects in mice with constitutive
      Vangl2 deletion. These alterations persisted into adulthood with NMJs
      disassembly leading to an impairment of neurotransmission and motor
      function deficits. Mechanistically, we found that Vangl2 and the
      muscle-specific kinase MuSK acted in the same genetic pathway and that
      Vangl2 binds MuSK, thus controlling its signaling activity. Our results
      identify Vangl2 as a key player of the core complex of molecules shaping
      neuromuscular synapses and shed light on the molecular mechanisms
      underlying NMJ assembly.

      Recently, my biomedical research seminar had the opportunity to read and
      discuss your paper. Detailed below are some of the comments we had on your
      work. 


      Strengths: We appreciated your figures also diagrammed your methods – for example, Figure 1A made it extremely clear what you were knocking out and how you were doing so. We also really appreciated that your figures were not all graphs/quantitative data, but also the IHC stains that were eventually used for data analysis (i.e. Figures 1D, 2C, 3A, 6C, 7A). 


      Weaknesses/Suggestions: While we did appreciate the IHC images, the quantitative graphs were too small and need to be enlarged to allow for easier data analysis. Additionally, certain figures were redundant – for example, both 4A and 4B show absolute force; similarly, both 4E and 4D show stimulation frequency and CMAP amplitude. Such redundancies convoluted the conversation, as students were confused what new information (if any) they were being presented with. Finally, the images need to be made more accessible to all readers – consider using magenta/blue stains to make data readable to colorblind readers, and include arrows in IHC stains so readers know what they are looking for. 


      Overall, we really appreciated your scientific writing and the significance of your work – finding the mechanism by which Vangl2 interacts with MuSK to affect neuromuscular activity. We believe that with these small revisions, you can improve your data presentation and make the science more accessible to the readers.

    title: Principles of gene regulation quantitatively connect DNA to RNA and
      proteins in bacteria
    category: systems-biology
    abstract: "Bacteria allocate their proteome to cellular functions differently in
      different growth conditions. It is largely unknown how such allocation
      arises from known mechanisms of gene regulation while constrained by
      limited translation capacity and fixed protein density. Here, we performed
      absolute transcriptomic and proteomic analysis for E. coli across many
      conditions, obtaining a plethora of results on promoters and mRNAs
      characteristics that clash with conventional expectations: the majority of
      mRNAs exhibit similar translational efficiencies, while the promoter
      strengths are vastly different across genes. These characteristics
      prescribe two principles of gene regulation guiding bacteria to attain the
      desired protein allocation under global constraints: Total transcriptional
      output is tightly coordinated with ribosomal activity, and the
      concentrations of individual proteins are largely set by transcription.
      These two principles lead to a quantitative formulation of Central Dogma
      which unravels the complex relationship between gene regulatory activities
      and mRNA/protein concentrations across conditions. The knowledge obtained
      will be invaluable for accurately inferring gene regulatory interactions

      Readers note: The authors make the following assumptions in all their
      analysis, which critically undermines several of their most important (and
      controversial) conclusions:


      1.   The authors are treating their ribosome profiling experiments as a measurement of translation rate. That's incorrect. Ribosome profiling measures the relative density of ribosomes bound to mRNAs. It is not a direct measurement of translation rate nor is it a direct measurement of translational efficiency.  


      Let me be clear with these terms: Translation rate is the number of proteins produced per mRNA per time. Translational efficiency is the number of proteins produced by a single transcript before it is degraded. Ribosome density is the translation initiation rate divided by the mRNA's translation elongation rate. 


      2.  The authors assume that all mRNAs have the same translation elongation rate in order to convert ribosome densities into translation rates. For example, in their Equation 5, epsilon (translation elongation rate) is just a single constant, used throughout to relate translation rates to protein synthesis rates and protein concentrations. This is incorrect. mRNAs do not all have the same translation elongation rate. There is a whole genre of literature on synonymous codon usage, the effects of synonymous codons on ribosome translocation speeds, and the use of codon optimization to increase heterologous protein expression levels. Epsilon is not a single constant. At the very least, if we only care about protein concentrations, one must consider the CDS-averaged translation elongation rate for each mRNA transcript in the transcriptome. 


      The authors' conclusion "Translation initiation rates are similar across mRNAs and growth conditions" needs to be revisited without assuming that all translation elongation rates are the same. Likewise, the conclusion that "Total mRNA abundance matches the translational capacity" depends on the veracity of this conclusion. The conclusion that "Constancy of ribosome spacing across mRNA and nutrient conditions" is more accurately viewed as "Constancy of *ribosome density* across mRNA and nutrient conditions".  Finally, the conclusion that "Total mRNA synthesis flux is adjusted to match translational capacity" is again dependent on the veracity of the first conclusion. 


      Concluding that all mRNAs have the same translation rate is bold. But it's not supported by data. If you see someone using ribosome profiling to make this claim, be skeptical!

    title: Pronounced genetic separation among varieties of the Primula cusickiana
      species complex, a Great Basin endemic
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Distinguishing between unique species and populations with strong
      genetic structure is a common challenge in population genetics, especially
      in fragmented habitats where allopatric speciation may be widespread and
      distinct groups may be morphologically similar. Such is often the case
      with species complexes across sky island environments. In these scenarios,
      biogeography may help to explain the relations between species complex
      members, and RADseq methods are commonly used to compare closely related
      species across thousands of genetic loci. Here we use RADseq to clarify
      the relations between geographically distinct but morphologically similar
      varieties of the Primula cusickiana species complex, and to contextualize
      past findings of strong genetic structure among populations within
      varieties. Our genomic analyses demonstrate pronounced separation between
      isolated populations of this Great Basin endemic, indicating that the
      current varietal classification of complex members is inaccurate and
      emphasizing their conservation importance. We discuss how these results
      correspond to recent biogeographical models used to describe the
      distribution of other sky island taxa in western North America. Our
      findings also fit into a wider trend observed for alpine Primula species
      complexes, and we consider how heterostylous breeding systems may be
      contributing to frequent diversification via allopatric speciation in this
      genus.

      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample

      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low

      They reversed the numbers for the Niaee study which was pivotal to their conclusion. See <a href="https://twitter.com/Covid19Crusher/status/1397214174766325765">this tweet from CovidAnalysis</a> for details on the switch. There is also a video from Niaee himself attesting to the fact ivermectin works. 


      When you use the correct data, it shows ivermectin works. No surprise.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and

      "...a yet-proven truth, that all the wearing of masks was futile..."

      Man, you are waaaay behind on real evidence. There's plenty of real research and data to show that no type of mask stops the SARS-CoV-2 virus and make no difference in COVID-19 infections, because the virus spreads through aerosol. 


      If you just wanna look at one place to see the list of evidence then look here: 

      1. https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/

      2. Or perhaps this section as well:

    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

      You have wrong data in the mortality analysis for Niaee study. You swaped
      IVM for Control. According to the study, 4 deaths from 116 occured in IVM
      and 11/49 occured in Control.


      Looking forward to your recalculation.

    raw_message: Keep looking, Norbert-man. Seems you cherry pick, which is what I
      suspect these researchers of doing too. That's politics, not science.
      Aerosol can get through, which means the effectiveness is not 100%. Unless
      there is  smart steering on board the tiny particles, or the mask material
      actually repels them, the mask will stop some. (It would be interesint for
      someone to find a smart mask material that draws the aerosol.) Note too,
      how vapor saturation of masks from the wearer's breath increases mask
      effectiveness. This is out there as well.

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

      The results and conclusions of this study are wrong.  The authors mistook
      the ivermectin and control arms of one of the RCTs that they
      included.  Look at figure 2.  The results from Niaee 2020 are dramatically
      misreported.  The actual results for that study are as follows:


      Control groups: 11 deaths out of 60 patients.

      Ivermectin groups: 4 deaths out of 90 patients.


      When this is corrected, the results of this meta-analysis confirm what other meta-analyses have found.  Ivermectin use is associated with approximately 66% reduction in Covid fatalities.  And this result is statistically significant.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted

      From your first link (1) - point (4) is misinformation and discredits the
      entire article and thus the site.


      The technical report in point is https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf, which states:


      "The evidence regarding the effectiveness of medical face masks for the prevention of COVID-19 in the community is compatible with a small to moderate protective effect, but there are still significant uncertainties about the size of this effect.", and


      "Although the evidence for the use of medical face masks in the community to prevent COVID-19 is limited, face masks should be considered as a non-pharmaceutical intervention in combination with other measures as part of efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic."


      I'm not even going to bother going over the other cherry-picked/misrepresented studies/reports.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles

      A further point needs to be made, before we throw away our masks -- that
      masks do not help the individual wearer. This research barely touches on
      that, thus is open to be used politically to cause virus spread.  And if
      an individual thought that this research showed that a mask does not help
      the wearer, it could cause many to shed their masks when it would be
      dangerous. 


      Here in my city, we just dropped off the "high risk" or "red" category last week, which means too many spreaders were walking around town, many willy nilly. Should I still be wearing a mask, can it stop the virus from getting to me? This study does not answer that question. If masks help as many studies shown or at least indicated, then public health officials need help now in getting the message out.


      Let's backtrack and attempt the assumptive leap for a moment and try to affirm that this study points to a yet-proven truth, that all the wearing of masks was futile, because of the ineffectiveness of the mask only, which even causes problems for wearers. Let's try to affirm that with a thought experiment. Imagine with me that what got invented is the dream 100% mask back in April 2020, that (1) when worn, causes no discomfort or infection in the wearer and (2) completely prevents any wearer from being able to catch the covid virus. What if any difference would this have made to the results of this study? The hypotheses this leads to have to do with how human behavior and politics help viruses spread -- even in the face of mask-wearing. 


      For instance, consider the work of Ngaire Woods, founding dean of the Blavatnik School of Government and professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford. In his article, "What factors have determined how well countries have done in responding to the pandemic?," Richard Smith, a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, writes that "Woods identified three factors that had a strong influence on how well countries did," and, "The single most important factor, she argued, was effective collaboration between national and subnational governments." 


      Could this be translated for our purposes here, to be that there was little "subversion" by the populace too, that more successful countries had fewer parties or funerals where masks were shed, events which I witnessed and attended. It only takes one bullet to hit a target, so catch the target when the mask is off or down under the nose. In other words, if you were a virus, how would you enlist "subversive grandmother soldiers," say, to unmask around their grandchildren, allowing a snaking trail of the virus to spread from household to household. How many people broke their social bubbles?

      This study reinforces an earlier Danish one published in the <i>Annals of
      Internal Medicine</i> which found that the result of mask wearing had so
      little statistical significance it could be "compatible with a 46%
      reduction to a 23% increase in infection."


      <blockquote>Results:

      A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.

      Well, it’s not whether there is a mandate in place, is it?

      <b>It’s whether the mandate is adhered to.

      And when people actually comply, and wear the masks, Covid spread declines.</b>

      <code>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249891</code>


      Funny how a disease spread primarily through droplet spread can be halted by methods that stop droplet spread, isn’t it?

      ...Who would have thought it?

    raw_message: It is not possible for masks to work. The virus size is akin to
      that of smoke of vaporizer particles. Cloth masks can't filter that sized
      particle. This has been know for years. Masks, like an N-95, must be
      fitted to be at all effective. Otherwise, you create strong side vent
      outgasings that just disperse the exhaled breath around the mask.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

            A large randomized community-based trial in which 4862 healthy
              participants were divided into a group wearing medical/surgical
              masks and a control group found no difference in infection with
              SARS-CoV-2. A recent systematic review found nine trials (of
              which eight were cluster-randomized controlled trials in which
              clusters of people, versus individuals, were randomized)
              comparing medical/surgical masks versus no masks to prevent the
              spread of viral respiratory illness. Two trials were with
              healthcare workers and seven in the community. The review
              concluded that wearing a mask may make little or no difference
              to the prevention of influenza-like illness.https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak

      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with

      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19

      I would like to read about that if you can provide a link. It makes more sense to me that as your mask gets coated with spit, it begins to act as a mesh nebulizer to convert the previously harmless big drops into aerosol droplets every time you exhale through the mask's tiny pores. Those can float around for hours and be inhaled by other people. In other words, if you are infected, putting on a mask turns you into a walking covid mosquito fogger.

      If masks worked as well as the faithful claim they do, we would see overwhelming correlation between mask use and reduced cases, deaths and hospitalizations. We don't. <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmsc">Ian Miller</a> tweets the non-proof every day.

      And what you're continuing is cherrypicking fear mongering - not
      science.  With word salad cherrypicking, hoping to get away with calling
      it "science".



      Jan 2021 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

            According to the current knowledge, the virus SARS-CoV-2 has a
              diameter of 60 nm to 140 nm [nanometers (billionth of a meter)],
              while medical and non-medical facemasks’ thread diameter ranges
              from 55 µm to 440 µm [micrometers (one millionth of a meter),
              which is more than 1000 times larger.  Due to the difference in
              sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter,
              SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask.

            

            A meta-analysis among health care workers
              found that compared to no masks, surgical mask and N95
              respirators were not effective against transmission of viral
              infections or influenza-like illness based on six RCTs. Using
              separate analysis of 23 observational studies, this meta-analysis
              found no protective effect of medical mask or N95 respirators
              against SARS virus. A recent systematic review of 39 studies
              including 33,867 participants in community settings (self-report
              illness), found no difference between N95 respirators versus
              surgical masks and surgical mask versus no masks in the risk for
              developing influenza or influenza-like illness, suggesting their
              ineffectiveness of blocking viral transmissions in community
              settings.

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.

      Yet another huge double mistake :

      In Fig.6 (viral clearance) for Karamat study, the number of events are WRONG, and they're represented on the WRONG SIDE. 

      Karamat counts nb of viral clearance at day 3 (17 IVM vs 2 control), then the *additional* number at day 7 (20 more in IVM group vs 18 more in control group). Fig.6 only counts the additional count between day 3 and day 7, and forgets what happened till day 3. 

      Hence the figures in Fig.6 for Karamat should be either "17 for Ivermectin and 2 for Control" or "37 for Ivermectin and 20 for Control". 

      And these figures are IN FAVOR of ivermectin. Even the wrong "20" and "18" should have been represented on the "favors IVM " side.

    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use

      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and

      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay

      Other mistakes seem to weigh on the results and on the conclusions.
      Examples :

      In Figure 3, how could the mean length of stay in Niaee's control group be smaller than the one in ivermectin group, when Niaee finds a significant reduction of stay with IVM ?

      In Figure 2 (Mortality), how can RR for Chaccour be 1 when there's no event ? (Shouldn't it be "not calculatable" ?)

      In Figure 5, (severe adverse events), one is included despite Krolewiecki mentions the one reported "has not been reported in association to IVM"

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      A legitimate question.  Will you take it at face value after it has been
      peer reviewed?

      I've been looking into the science behind mask mandates for a while now and there is literally NOT ONE RCT study which has found masks (or respirators for that matter) to be effective to reduce the transmission of viral illness.  Other things like droplets, sure, but not viral illness.

      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse

      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.

      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to

      When the data for Niaee study was corrected for version 2 the weights
      given to the studies were also changed. The weights in figure 2 changed in
      a way that is hard to explain by the Niaee data fix alone.


      Was any other parameter adjusted for version 2 than data for Niaee study? If so, on what basis was the other parameters changed?

      Seeing people going back and forth here, but I'll just point this out:


      If wearing masks are really that effective, as some claim, how are medical staff getting infected <i>on the job</i> despite the extra medical gear, protection, and protocols? The overwhelming majority of you can only provide conjecture <i>at best.</i> If medical staff adhering to strict sanitation protocols still get infected by a respiratory illness </I>on site,</I> what makes anyone believe that less effective equipment, or less physical coverage provided by said equipment, would be effective for a general population less equipped to adhere to stricter sanitation protocols?

      Seriously, it’s like some researchers opposed to the concept of EARLY
      treatment of COVID will go to any lengths to provide evidence against it,
      even if it crosses the line of scientific ethics.


      Sorry, to have to say this but the authors no longer have any credibility on this issue.

       Extremely important to recognize the importance of this: to provide evidence against IVM researchers have had to change data to fit their conclusion.

       What does that tell you about the effectiveness of IVM?

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    raw_message: If you follow real science (of which there is a great deal on this
      subject). There has never been any that can show any advantage of mask
      wearing for a viral issue. Theories on water droplet dispersion rates,
      etc., abound. But the hard evidence clearly and repeatedly shows that the
      spread of any virus is not affected in the least by wearing a mask. It's
      like trying to keep flies out with a chain link fence.

    raw_message: It’s astonishing that anyone thinks that this study is in any way
      scientific, controlled, with conclusions based on anything but bias. It’s
      alarming that such nonsense writings like these are even taken seriously
      enough for someone to decide to publish it, spread it around the internet.
      The times of truth, fact and reality ruling the day, are behind us. They
      are destroying science and destroying our democracy. That is very sad

    raw_message: I find it interesting that those states that implemented early mask
      mandates have slightly high death rates than states that never implemented
      masking.  In addition, when new case rates were at the highest we also had
      >93% mask compliance in those states that required masks.  The real world
      data seems to refute your position.

    raw_message: You obviously don't grasp what they are saying.  Mandates
      absolutely increased the amount of people wearing masks.  Even though
      those mandates were in place, the data shows that it did not slow the
      spread of Covid during times of Covid surges.  Ergo, the mandate and
      wearing masks do decrease the rate of transmission.

    abstract: Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants recently identified in India
      designated B.1.617 and B.1.618 have mutations within the spike protein
      that may contribute to their increased transmissibility and that could
      potentially result in re-infection or resistance to vaccine-elicited
      antibody. B.1.617 encodes a spike protein with mutations L452R, E484Q,
      D614G and P681R while the B.1.618 spike has mutations {Delta}145-146,
      E484K and D614G. We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant
      proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent
      sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.
      Viruses with B.1.617 and B.1.618 spike were neutralized with a 2-5-fold
      decrease in titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies.
      The E484Q and E484K versions were neutralized with a 2-4-fold decrease in
      titer. Virus with the B.1.617 spike protein was neutralized with a
      4.7-fold decrease in titer by the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail
      as a result of the L452R mutation. The modest neutralization resistance of
      the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that
      current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618
      variants.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing

      I'm skeptical of both studies. The one you linked to has a small sample
      size, and I don't like that it reported a coefficient (140 cases/100,000),
      which is small, and doesn't note that there were wide overlapping
      confidence intervals in its conclusions. Really wide. Did you check the
      chart? 


      This study on this page seems anti-mask agenda-driven, and its conclusions in the summary are over-generalized. There probably is not a statistically significant difference between mask-mandate states and non-mask mandate states, but that doesn't mean masks never work. 


      A mandate to wear a mask walking down a city street is not the same as a mandate to wear one when visiting someone in a hospital or a brief visit in some other close-up situation. But both studies tend to treat these as roughly the same. 


      There's clearly a lot more research needed on this. Most of the studies done in 2020 are junk, proven inaccurate by the historical data.

      The study states the mandate didn’t slow spread.

      But we know that the mandate is irrelevant, it’s whether it is properly adhered to and whether people are compliant with a range of measures that is important.

      Well, your argument would just verify my point...it’s the wearing of masks
      that cuts Covid transmission, not whether there is some advice in place to
      do so.

      But of course one needs to wear them properly, or they may not work. 


      An suitable analogy might be as follows:

      “Installation of clean water and sewage facilities does not cut dysentery risk”

      If one finds that a significant number of the population are refusing to practice basic hygiene and are still defecating in the wells used for drinking, do you think the study conclusion should be “Public health interventions do not stop the spread of dysentery”, and for governments to cease to provide tap water and toilets for their citizens?


      PS: The reuse of surgical masks depends upon their contamination. They are used for 4-6 hours continuously in hospital settings. It’s advised that you wear a new mask if as a member of the public you are taking one off and then need to remask. There is an elements of common sense here... if I am going into say Tesco’s for a few minutes, then into Boots 5 minutes later, I might for the sake of convenience just put on the mask again, assuming I have kept it clean in the interim. I notice some people “wearing their mask” in open air spaces in towns, usually because they are going from one shop to the next a few doors down. Taking the mask off between those times seems more trouble than it’s worth, so they leave it on. This week I was dropping in at the petrol station attached to my local Tesco superstore, so I didn’t bother to take off my mask, drove 300 yds in the car while wearing my mask, then got petrol. No big deal. I didn’t die from hypoxia, but no doubt some antimasker laughed when they saw me wearing the mask in the car.

      Just use your common sense, I say. There’s not much of that about these days.

      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

    title: The IL-10GFP (VeRT-X) mouse strain is not suitable for the detection of
      IL-10 production by granulocytes during lung inflammation
    category: immunology
    abstract: The clear and unequivocal identification of immune effector functions
      is essential to understand immune responses. The cytokine IL-10 is a
      critical immune regulator and was shown, for example, to limit pathology
      during various lung diseases. However, the clear identification of
      IL-10-producing cells is challenging and, therefore, reporter mouse lines
      were developed to facilitate their detection. Several such reporter lines
      utilize GFP, including the IL-10 GFP (VeRT-X) reporter strain studied
      here. In line with previous reports, we found that this IL-10 GFP line
      faithfully reports on the IL-10 production of lymphoid cells. However, we
      show that the IL-10 GFP reporter is not suitable to analyse IL-10
      production of myeloid cells during inflammations. During inflammation, the
      autofluorescence of myeloid cells increased to an extent that entirely
      masked the IL-10-specific GFP-signal. Our data illustrate a general and
      important technical caveat using GFP-reporter lines for the analysis of
      myeloid cells and suggest that previous reports on effector functions of
      myeloid cells using such GFP-based reporters might require re-evaluation.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    abstract: Proper cell fate determination is largely orchestrated by complex gene
      regulatory networks centered around transcription factors. However,
      experimental elucidation of key transcription factors that drive cellular
      identity is currently often intractable. Here, we present ANANSE (ANalysis
      Algorithm for Networks Specified by Enhancers), a network-based method
      that exploits enhancerencoded regulatory information to identify the key
      transcription factors in cell fate determination. As cell type-specific
      transcription factors predominantly bind to enhancers, we use regulatory
      networks based on enhancer properties to prioritize transcription factors.
      First, we predict genome-wide binding profiles of transcription factors in
      various cell types using enhancer activity and transcription factor
      binding motifs. Subsequently, applying these inferred binding profiles, we
      construct cell type-specific gene regulatory networks, and then predict
      key transcription factors controlling cell fate conversions using
      differential gene networks between cell types. This method outperforms
      existing approaches in correctly predicting major transcription factors
      previously identified to be sufficient for trans-differentiation. Finally,
      we apply ANANSE to define an atlas of key transcription factors in 18
      normal human tissues. In conclusion, we present a ready-to-implement
      computational tool for efficient prediction of transcription factors in
      cell fate determination and to study transcription factor-mediated
      regulatory mechanisms. ANANSE is freely available at
      https://github.com/vanheeringen-lab/ANANSE.

    raw_message: The burden of proof is on the entity wanting to enforce mask
      mandates that mask mandates actually work. There is no burden to prove
      that masks don't work. This study (and many others) set out to determine
      if mask mandates work (reduce transmission rates) and was not able to
      establish any correlation between mandates and reduced transmission rates.
      Hence, the burden of proof is still on the maskers to prove that masks
      work - not on anti-maskers to prove they don't.

      both the data on deaths and the data on the number of individuals infected
      are subject to many different biases. We consider a Bayesian evidence
      synthesis approach which, while simple enough for researchers to
      understand and use, accounts for many important sources of uncertainty
      inherent in both the seroprevalence and mortality data. We estimate the
      COVID-19 IFR to be 0.40% (95% credible interval of (0.20%, 0.63%)) for a
      typical population where the proportion of those aged over 65 years old is
      9% and where the GDP (at purchasing-power parity (ppp)) per capita is
      $17.8K (the approximate worldwide values). Our results suggest that, as
      one might expect, lower IFRs are associated with younger and with
      wealthier populations.

    title: "scTenifoldKnk: a machine learning workflow performing virtual knockout
      experiments on single-cell gene regulatory networks"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Gene knockout (KO) experiments are a proven approach for studying gene
      function. A typical KO experiment usually involves the phenotypic
      characterization of KO organisms. The recent advent of single-cell
      technology has greatly boosted the resolution of cellular phenotyping,
      providing unprecedented insights into cell-type-specific gene function.
      However, the use of single-cell technology in large-scale, systematic KO
      experiments is prohibitive due to the vast resources required. Here we
      present scTenifoldKnk, a machine learning workflow that performs virtual
      KO experiments using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.
      scTenifoldKnk first uses data from wild-type (WT) samples to construct a
      single-cell gene regulatory network (scGRN). Then, a gene is knocked out
      from the constructed scGRN by setting weights of the gene's outward edges
      to zeros. ScTenifoldKnk then compares this "pseudo-KO" scGRN with the
      original scGRN to identify differentially regulated (DR) genes. These DR
      genes, also called virtual-KO perturbed genes, are used to assess the
      impact of the gene KO and reveal the gene's function in analyzed cells.
      Using existing data sets, we demonstrate that the scTenifoldKnk analysis
      recapitulates the main findings of three real-animal KO experiments and
      confirms the functions of genes underlying three Mendelian diseases. We
      show the power of scTenifoldKnk as a predictive method to successfully
      predict the outcomes of two KO experiments that involve intestinal
      enterocytes in Ahr-/- mice and pancreatic islet cells in Malat1-/- mice,
      respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the use of scTenifoldKnk to perform
      systematic KO analyses, in which a large number of genes are virtually
      deleted, allowing gene functions to be revealed in a cell type-specific
      manner.

      Dear Samuel,


      Thank you very much for your interest in our work, as well as for your thorough review and comments. We will try our best to solve your questions below:


      1.	We agree with your point of view about the effect of a gene knockout on cellular homeostasis. In fact, in metabolic models where this kind of analysis is usually done using optimization approaches, the propagation effect of the gene knockout across several parts of the metabolism is evident. Nevertheless, Santolini and Barabasi (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1720589115) compared the performance of the topology to predict the perturbation patterns caused by a gene knockout against the result of the optimization methods. They found a good overlap in the prediction, and based on those findings; we decided to use the topological approach. We did not try multi-knockout experiments since, as you mention single-cell RNA-seq characterization for those experiments is not yet available. However, we did try a double knockout and found a good overlap with the findings reported by the paper describing the dataset (Figure 3, Panel C). We yet do not have any other evidence to support or reject your hypothesis about the decrease of the precision of the predictions with an increasing number of knocked-out genes at the same time. 


      2.	Since the regulatory link between two genes is assessed using principal components regression (PCR), the result after evaluating all the associations is a fully connected asymmetric weighted network. You may consider PCR as a partial correlation analysis (pcorr). When C1 and C2 are the same, pcorr(A,B|C1) equals pcorr(B,A|C2). However, in PCR, C1 is not equal to C2—C1 is all genes excluding B, while C2 is all genes excluding A. This asymmetry makes the result of PCR an asymmetric matrix. To further set the directionality of the resultant matrix, first, we removed the weaker link between two genes, and then, we filtered the links below the 95th percentile to reduce the false-positive rate. We provided evidence supporting that the true directionality of the regulation is favored by the regression method with a larger weight value (Figure S1, Panel C) when the directionality is tested using the transcription factors and their target genes reported by the ENCODE database. We also provided evidence of the accuracy of principal components regression to detect the association between genes in single-cell RNA-seq without imputation compared with other methods during the benchmark of scTenifoldNet (Figure 2, Panel A in DOI:10.1016/j.patter.2020.100139).


      3.	We are afraid we have to disagree with you on this. We did our best to perform an unbiased comparison of the gene knockout phenotypic effect reported by the authors of the datasets and the results provided by scTenifoldKnk. In fact, the characterizations made for the authors are not only based on data-driven approaches using the generated single-cell RNA-seq datasets but also include other experimental techniques. We used several gene-set databases to evaluate the extent of the overlap that we can predict, as it is recognized that a single gene or pathway often cannot fully explain a particular cellular state. Instead, biological processes are better characterized by gene regulatory networks, whose structures are altered as the phenotype changes (DOI: 10.1038/s41540-018-0052-5). We thought about reporting the result of scTenifoldNet and compare them with the results predicted by scTenifoldKnk. Still, since we are the developers of both methods, we decided to better compare our findings with the results reported by the original authors of the datasets. Please note that the original authors did not report all the changes or perturbed gene sets found after the gene knockout. We believe your experimental design is correct and feasible. However, also have in mind that not all the regulatory changes induced by a gene are detectable as changes in the expression level since a given gene may be under the regulation of more of one gene at the same time.


      4.	To evaluate the stability and robustness of the results provided by scTenifoldKnk, we used two approaches. First, we compared the results obtained by running independently scTenifoldKnk over two biological replicates in the Mecp2 example (Figure S2, Panel D) and found that the overlapping results agree with what is known about the Rett Syndrome pathology that is caused by the malfunctioning of the Mecp2 gene. Second, we resampled the cells used as input for scTenifoldKnk 10 times and compared the rank of the perturbed genes in the predicted in-silico knockout for each one of them. Since single-cell RNA-seq allows to uncover hidden subpopulations of cells with specialized phenotypes, and for that reason, by random subsampling the cells, we expect each of the constructed gene regulatory networks to be unique and provide a unique result. Because the approach is the same and the expected biological effect is the same (randomly sampling cells), we only performed the analysis over the Trem2 dataset. We expect the results to be similar in the other datasets.  


      Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns,


      Best wishes,


      Daniel and James

    title: Balanced mitochondrial and cytosolic translatomes underlie the biogenesis
      of human respiratory complexes
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes consist of nuclear and
      mitochondrial DNA- encoded subunits. Their biogenesis requires
      cross-compartment gene regulation to mitigate the accumulation of
      disproportionate subunits. To determine how human cells coordinate
      mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression processes, we established an
      optimized ribosome profiling approach tailored for the unique features of
      the human mitoribosome. Analysis of ribosome footprints in five cell types
      revealed that average mitochondrial synthesis rates corresponded precisely
      to cytosolic rates across OXPHOS complexes. Balanced mitochondrial and
      cytosolic synthesis did not rely on rapid feedback between the two
      translation systems. Rather, LRPPRC, a gene associated with Leigh's
      syndrome, is required for the reciprocal translatomes and maintains
      cellular proteostasis. Based on our findings, we propose that human
      mitonuclear balance is enabled by matching OXPHOS subunit synthesis rates
      across cellular compartments, which may represent a vulnerability for
      cellular proteostasis.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      This is not good information, and the research is not well done. 


      They used a two-tailed t test with Holm Sidak correction, as if that is suffient to compensate for the complex interplay of factors that produce the same result (infection/non infection). Hell, they even made a simple linear regression to add insult to injury. 


      Essentially, to explain it more simply, using those tests rests on the assumption that there are 2 categories that correlate to other to categories perfectly- mask/not mask and infected/not infected. 


      This is not the case. Masks wearers that social distance will have lesses infection rates than mask wearers who do not. Ventialtion of enclosed areas is also an issue. 


      These "researchers" did not account for the confounding variables that affect infection rates- everything from other measures to testing rate differences among states. 


      Overall, there are many flaws with this research. Not good.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      I think you do have a couple fair points and I myself am a bit critical of
      the paper and agree that concluding masks wearing is not helpful is rash
      on this paper alone. However, Some of the factors that you mention should
      be held constant are, practically, infeasible in my opinion. How do you
      measure amount of enforcement objectively and their effect on mask
      wearing?

      Mask use potentially causing breaches of social distancing, while maybe true, are out of scope of the paper. Even under the assumption that that's true, that event would technically be encouraged under mandated states due to increased mask wearing and I think is fair to say is an unintended effect of mask wearing mandates.


      More research definitely does need to be done on this because, as you point out, a lot of factors could be compounding to mitigate any effectiveness mandates by themselves would bring but discrediting the paper because they do not explore all possible factors is not helpful either. If all papers were to explore all possible factors every time, publications would be few and far between.

    category: microbiology
    first_posted: 2021-05-28
    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains a suboptimal furin
      cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction with the sequence 681PRRAR/S686. This
      cleavage site is required for efficient airway replication, transmission,
      and pathogenicity of the virus. The B.1.617 lineage has recently emerged
      in India, coinciding with substantial disease burden across the country.
      Early evidence suggests that B.1.617.2 (a sublineage of B.1.617) is more
      highly transmissible than contemporary lineages. B.1.617 and its
      sublineages contain a constellation of S mutations including the
      substitution P681R predicted to further optimise this furin cleavage site.
      In this short report we provide experimental evidence that virus of the
      B.1.617 lineage has enhanced S cleavage, that enhanced processing of an
      expressed B.1.617 S protein in cells is due to P681R, and that this
      mutation enables more efficient cleavage of a peptide mimetic of the
      B.1.617 S1/S2 cleavage site by recombinant furin. Together, these data
      demonstrate viruses in this emerging lineage have enhanced S cleavage by
      furin which we hypothesise could be enhancing transmissibility and
      pathogenicity.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      The idea of looking at patients who had at least a substantial cumulated
      dose is great, but there is an important immortal time bias, since the
      patients can't die the first 10 days in the HCQ group, as seen on the
      Kaplan-Meïer


      I suggest to calculate again the results with excluding the first 10 days death in the control group.


      Due to the small group size, you will probably loose significance, but it still will be usefull for pooled analysis.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

      The article is interesting. A few questions to the authors. Did you
      pre-specify the definition of negative PCR?

      Did you compare changes in viral loads from the baseline? Since the median viral load was higher in the placebo arm, this might have affected the likelihood of viral clearance at day 6 and it should be accounted for.

      This research is problematic. 

      First, this clinical trial's primary outcome measures were as attached below. And authors did not mention 2 out of 3 primary outcome measures. These are not good omissions apparently. 


      Second even the primary outcome measure they used was not specified before the study. Authors used ct cut value of 30, which was arbitrary. Authors explain why they did not use 40, but they must have used 40 if that leads to the good results. And that is not a clinical trial. 


      They did not correct for multiple comparisons across three primary endpoints, either, which they should have done as there are three primary endpoints. 




      Second as the figure 2 and the table shows the ct values of two groups before the intervention are close to statistically significant differences (p = 0.10).

      And as the figure 2 shows this group difference did not show even a hint of change at day 6! The two groups were almost statistically different from the beginning and that did not change visually at day 6 apparently. I can't see any hints of effects of IVM from this study. 




      Lay persons are watching this study, and they say they love IVM and hate vaccine and let's use IVM instead of vaccine based on this study's result. We hope authors do the proper research. They should provide three primary endpoints, correct the preexisting differences, and correct multiple comparisons, and should provide apparent conclusions. 






      Primary Outcome Measures  :
            


      Viral clearance at day 6 [ Time Frame: Outcome will be determined till 6 days post intervention ]



      The primary outcome will be the viral clearance at day 6 in the intervention group compared to placebo.


                  	


      Viral shedding duration [ Time Frame: Outcome will be determined till 14 days post intervention ]



      Secondary outcomes: viral shedding duration (time between first positive PCR to last of two consecutive negative tests)


                  	


      Symptoms clearance time [ Time Frame: Outcome will be determined till 14 days post intervention ]



      Time between drug treatment and symptoms resolution

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      That is not a good point. 


      Medical personel are more exposed to the virus than the general population. Errors in use of protective equipment will produce greater infections than the equivalent errors in the general population. 


      Also, the use of masks as source control (controlling the spread instead of just preventing infection) has been demonstrated as effective thorlugh research and practice for more than a 100 years.

    abstract: We analyzed data from two ongoing COVID-19 longitudinal serological
      surveys in Orange County, CA., between April 2020 and March 2021. A total
      of 8,476 finger stick blood specimens were collected before and after an
      aggressive mRNA vaccination campaign. IgG levels were determined using a
      multiplex antigen microarray containing 10 SARS-CoV-2 antigens, 4 SARS, 3
      MERS, 12 Common CoV, and 8 Influenza antigens. Twenty-six percent of 3,347
      specimens from unvaccinated Orange County residents in December 2020 were
      SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. The Ab response was predominantly against
      nucleocapsid (NP), full length spike and the spike S2 domain.
      Anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) reactivity was low and there was no
      cross-reactivity against SARS S1 or SARS RBD. An aggressive mRNA
      vaccination campaign at the UCI Medical Center started on December 16,
      2020 and 6,724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks.
      Seroprevalence increased from 13% in December to 79% in January, 93% in
      February and 99% in March. mRNA vaccination induced much higher Ab levels
      especially against the RBD domain and significant cross-reactivity against
      SARS RBD and S1 was also observed. Nucleocapsid protein Abs can be used to
      distinguish individuals in a population of vaccinees to classify those who
      have been previously infected and those who have not, because nucleocapsid
      is not in the vaccine. Previously infected individuals developed higher Ab
      titers to the vaccine than those who have not been previously exposed.
      These results indicate that mRNA vaccination rapidly induces a much
      stronger and broader Ab response than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      I've only attempted to fact check your second source, the Denmark one, and
      your quotes really show your bias here. I could not find the first one cuz
      your reference kinda sucks. I attempted to ctrl f both quotes, and the
      first one "The researchers found no statistically significant difference
      between mask wearers and bare-faced participants." does not exist. 


      The second one while partially true, is cut off from what is actually said. The real quote is:


      "The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection". 


      Note here where they specify the limitations of their study. Their conclusion is less general than, "does not reduce infection rate", but rather that when everyone else does not where masks, mask wearing does not appear to help. Their study, if you did actually read it, is only relevant to the specific scenario in the quote and by the authors notes while responding to comments “the findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.”


      If you are going to cite papers, please read them instead of skimming for anything that you believe.

    title: COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is not detected in human milk
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: Several countries have recently approved the use of mRNA vaccines
      against COVID-19 under an emergency use authorization. However, no
      pregnant or lactating individuals were included in the Phase 3 clinical
      trials of these vaccines despite belonging to a group at high risk for
      severe complications of COVID-19 infection. We show here that the mRNA
      from anti-COVID vaccines is not detected in human breast milk samples
      collected 4-48 hours post-vaccine. These results strengthen the
      recommendation of ABM and WHO that lactating individuals who receive the
      anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine should continue to breastfeed their
      infants uninterrupted.

      Nice, but irrelevant. The worry has been that the mRNA encoded <i><b>spike protein</b></i> gets into breast milk (and other tissues). 




      There does not appear to be any concern that the mRNA itself appears in breast milk. So the paper of Golan, et al., is irrelevant to the concern.

    title: Interim estimates of increased transmissibility, growth rate, and
      reproduction number of the Covid-19 B.1.617.2 variant of concern in the
      United Kingdom
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: This paper relates to data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK,
      regarding Covid-19 genomic surveillance. We use a simple model to give
      point estimates of the effective reproduction numbers of the B.1.617.2 and
      B.1.1.7 lineages in England, from sequenced data as at 15 May 2021.
      Comparison with the estimated reproduction number of B.1.1.7 enables an
      estimate of the increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2. We conclude that
      it is almost certain that there is increased transmissibility that will
      rapidly lead to B.1.617.2 becoming the prevailing variant in the UK. The
      derived estimates of increased transmissibility have uncertainty relating
      to the actual distribution of the generation interval, but they do point,
      under present conditions of vaccination coverage and NPIs, to exponential
      growth of positive cases.

      This was posted on the day Public Health England released a report showing that the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is currently 73% of sequenced cases - i.e. it was 73% of new cases a couple of weeks ago. S gene proxy data is only a week out of date and has the prevalence of Delta at 85.4%


      Forget journals not being able to keep up, even preprints can't keep up with this.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: Insights into the ligand-free structure of cyclic diguanosine
      monophosphate I riboswitch of Vibrio cholerae using molecular dynamics
      simulation
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Riboswitches are key cis regulatory elements present at 5' UTRs of
      mRNAs. They play a critical role in gene expression regulation at
      transcriptional and translational level by binding selectively to specific
      ligands followed by conformational changes. Ligands bind to the aptamer of
      riboswitches and their complex structures have been solved, but
      ligand-free riboswitches structures are not available which is important
      to understand specific ligand binding mechanism. In this paper, an all
      atom 150 nano-second (ns) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cyclic
      diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP I) riboswitch aptamer domain from
      Vibrio cholerae were carried out to study ligand-free c-di-GMP I
      riboswitch aptamer structure and the binding mechanism. The Principle
      component analysis, cross correlation dynamics analysis and trajectory
      analyses revealed that the ligand-free structure has stable conformation
      with folded P2, P3 and an open P1 helix which opens the ligand binding
      helix-join-helix while the ligand-bound structure shows less deviation and
      remains as closed structure compared to the ligand-free structure. The
      junction residues significantly showed anti-correlated motions with each
      other elucidating the open conformation of the ligand-free aptamer of
      riboswitch. The identified key residues involved in binding are A18, G20,
      C46, A47 and C92.

    abstract: The role of T cells in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been
      underestimated in favor of neutralizing antibodies. However, cellular
      immunity is essential for long-term viral control and protection from
      disease severity. To understand T-cell immunity in the absence of antibody
      generation we focused on a group of SARS-CoV-2 Non-Seroconvertors (NSC)
      recovered from infection. We performed an immune comparative analysis of
      SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals stratified by the absence or presence of
      seroconversion and disease severity. We report high levels of total naive
      and low effector CD8+ T cells in NSC. Moreover, polyfunctional
      Nucleocapsid (NP)-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, as well as reduced
      levels of T-cell activation monitored by PD-1 and activation-induced
      markers, were distinctive immunological traits in NSC. Longitudinal data
      support the stability of the NSC phenotype over three months. Our results
      implicate highly functional SARS-CoV-2 Spike and NP T-cell responses with
      low immune activation in protection from disease severity in the absence
      of seroconversion.

    title: Mayaro Virus Infection Elicits an Innate Immune Response and Represses
      Autophagy in Anopheles stephensi
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an arboviral pathogen in the genus Alphavirus
      that is circulating in South America with potential to spread to naive
      regions. MAYV is also one of the few viruses with the ability to be
      transmitted by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles in addition to the
      typical arbovirus transmitting mosquitoes in the genus Aedes. Few studies
      have investigated the infection response of Anopheles mosquitoes to
      arboviruses. In this study we detail the transcriptomic and small RNA
      responses of An. stephensi to infection with MAYV via infectious bloodmeal
      at 2, 7, and 14 days post infection (dpi). 487 unique transcripts were
      significantly regulated and 79 novel miRNAs were identified. Gene ontology
      analysis of transcripts regulated at each timepoint suggested activation
      of the Toll pathway at 7 dpi and repression of pathways related to
      autophagy at 14 dpi. These findings provide a basic understanding of the
      infection response of An. stephensi to MAYV and help to identify host
      factors which might be useful to target to inhibit viral replication in
      Anopheles mosquitoes.

      nucleus compared to cytosol of mammalian cells
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: An extensive network of chaperones and other proteins maintain protein
      homeostasis and guard against inappropriate protein aggregation that is a
      hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. Using a fluorescence resonance
      energy-based biosensor that simultaneously reports on intact cellular
      chaperone holdase activity and detrimental aggregation propensity, we
      investigated the buffering capacity of the systems managing protein
      homeostasis in the nucleus of the human cell line HEK293 compared to the
      cytosol. We found that the nucleus showed lower net holdase activity and
      reduced capacity to suppress protein aggregation, suggesting that the
      nuclear quality control resources are less effective compared to those in
      the cytosol. Aggregation of mutant huntingtin exon 1 protein (Httex1) in
      the cytosol appeared to deplete cytosolic chaperone supply by depleting
      holdase activity. Unexpectedly, the same stress increased holdase activity
      in the nucleus suggesting that proteostasis stress can trigger a rebalance
      of chaperone supply in different subcellular compartments. Collectively
      the findings suggest the cytosol has more capacity to manage imbalances in
      proteome foldedness than the nucleus, but chaperone supply can be
      redirected into the nucleus under conditions of proteostasis stress caused
      by cytosolic protein aggregation.

      <b>Summary:</b>

      In the cell, there is an extensive network of protein quality control machinery that maintains protein homeostasis. A disruption in this network may lead to protein aggregation, which is a hallmark for many neurodegenerative diseases. This has prompted a need to develop a biosensor that can measure chaperone activity in the cell, which the authors have done in their previous work (Wood, R. et al. 2018. Nat. Comm.). One way to gauge chaperone activity is to measure their ability to bind unfolded proteins, also known as “holdase” activity, to prevent aggregation. We found that the authors give a helpful explanation of how their previously-designed biosensor works, reducing the need for the reader to reference the previous publication.


      In this manuscript, the authors improve upon this tool to include nuclear localization or export sequences (NLS or NES, respectively) to probe protein homeostasis in the nucleus or cytosol, respectively. This control of biosensor localization is very impressive. Using this new capability, they show that 1) holdase activity in the cytosol is more abundant than in the nucleus and 2) imbalance in protein homeostasis - by co-expressing the huntingtin exon 1 mutant -  can reallocate chaperone supply in different areas of the cell. 


      A long-standing view in the proteostasis field is that the quality control machinery is more abundant in the cytosol. Their new biosensor supports this view by showing that there is more holdase activity detected in the cytosol than in the nucleus.


      The authors show that Huntingtin (Htt) inclusions can affect the fluorescence analysis of cells via flow cytometry. We appreciate that they addressed this limitation of their biosensor. They propose a workaround by measuring FRET using microscopy instead of their flow cytometry method. Using this workaround, the authors find evidence that the cell can reallocate quality control machinery between the cytosol and the nucleus.


      By adding the NLS or NES, the authors have extended the biosensor’s capability to answer more questions about proteostasis. While the constructed biosensor only used barnase, which binds to Hsp70 and Hsp40 family chaperones, as the model protein, the scheme suggests a potential to expand the scope of the biosensor by using different model proteins that bind other quality control proteins beyond Hsp70 and Hsp40 families.


      <b>Major Points: </b>


      The authors modify their previously-developed biosensor to restrict its localization to either the cytosol or nucleus using an NES or NLS, respectively. Because protein folding is essential to the biosensor’s function, the authors validate these new modifications by measuring protein stability via urea denaturation of the wild type* (WT*) barnase. The authors only perform the validation for the WT* but not for the mutants. Could the differences in the lower slope gradient observed in Figure 2B for the mutants be due to the NES or NLS affecting the mutant barnase stability differently than WT*? 


      There seems to be a discrepancy between data from Fig 2B and Fig 3B. Fig 2B shows that there is a lower slope gradient in the cytosol than in the nucleus. Looking more closely at Fig 3B, it almost looks like the nucleus has a lower slope gradient than the cytosol. This contradicts the conclusion from Fig 2B that the cytosol has more holdase activity when in Fig 3B, it looks like the nucleus has more. How could these differences be reconciled? 


      <b>Minor Points:</b>


      <u>Introduction:</u>

      In page 1 line 57, the abundance of unfolded-like barnase is not detected by FRET but rather by the absence of FRET


      Duplicate citations on refs. 5 and 6


      In the paragraph that starts on page 1/line 59, I was able to understand the motivation for creating the biosensor. However, the authors go on to explain that they added localization sequences without motivating a reason for why the comparison between the nucleus and the cytosol is important. The authors have this information in their discussion (line 226-227) and a brief mention of this in the introduction would help motivate the study.


      <u>Methods:</u>

      In line 270, it was unclear to me what it means to “decouple the expression of the two plasmids”. More detail in this section would also help in the ease of reproducibility of the work. 


      Catalog numbers should be included for all materials


      In line 280, there’s a typo. “Ovine” should be “bovine”


      We like that the authors provide scripts alongside the example datasets for their image analysis. This aids in reproducibility


      <u>Figure 1:</u>

      Labeling style for Fig 1A could benefit from the cartoon in the style of the (Wood, R. et al. 2018. Nat. Comm. Fig. 1), where the conformations of the bait, as well as the other proteins, were explicitly shown


      We are curious about how the linker control was designed since the linker control was not introduced in the initial biosensor paper (Wood, R. et al. 2018. Nat. Comm.) Which factors determine the linker control’s length and its amino acid sequence? 


      It looks like both localization sequences (NLS and NES) are appended to the biosensor in Fig 1A, which contrasts with what described in the Results.


      Fig 1D, unclear that they didn’t label “D” and “A”


      Mentioning that urea acts as a denaturing agent would be helpful, especially to newcomers unfamiliar with the assay


      <u>Figure 2:</u>

      Figure 2C: How was the percentage of cells with aggregates calculated? Legend of the figure suggest that the percentage is derived from the ratio (upper slope)/(lower slope)


      In Line 113-114, the authors observed that the I25A I96G mutant was potentially outside of the detected dynamic range of the biosensor. However, the I25A,I96G mutant was still used in subsequent experiments without providing further explanations.


      <u>Figure 3:</u>

      Fig 1 and 3, using the same color for the Hoechst dye would help better with continuity across figures


      What drove the choice for using the Y66L Emerald as the transfection control rather than an empty vector? 


      <u>Figure 4:</u>

      It would be useful to see a color map for the FRET map on the side to get a better idea of the range


      What does white or red arrow mean in figure 4? We think that the white arrow indicates inclusion-targeted and the red arrow indicates diffuse-targeted


      The signal that the white arrow is referring to in Figure 4A for the nucleus is barely visible


      In Figure 4, would it be possible to use different line styles for the WT* and the mutants?


      In Figure 4, WT should be labeled as WT*

    title: "Hackflex: low cost Illumina Nextera Flex sequencing library construction"
    category: genomics
    abstract: We developed a low-cost method for the production of
      Illumina-compatible sequencing libraries that allows up to 14 times more
      libraries for high-throughput Illumina sequencing to be generated for the
      same cost. We call this new method Hackflex. Quality of library
      preparation was tested by constructing libraries from E. coli MG1655
      genomic DNA using either Hackflex, standard Nextera Flex or a variation of
      standard Nextera Flex in which the bead-linked transposase is diluted
      prior to use. In order to test the library quality for genomes with a
      higher and a lower GC content, library construction methods were also
      tested on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and S. aureus ATCC25923, respectively. We
      demonstrated that Hackflex can produce high quality libraries and yields a
      highly uniform coverage, equivalent to the standard Nextera Flex kit. We
      show that strongly size selected libraries produce sufficient yield and
      complexity to support de novo microbial genome assembly, and that
      assemblies of the large insert libraries can be much more contiguous than
      standard libraries without strong size selection. We introduce a new set
      of sample barcodes that are distinct from standard Illumina barcodes,
      enabling Hackflex samples to be multiplexed with samples barcoded using
      standard Illumina kits. Using Hackflex, we were able to achieve a per
      sample reagent cost for library prep of A$7.22 (USD$5.60), which is 9.87
      times lower than the Standard Nextera Flex protocol at advertised retail
      price. An additional simple modification and further simplification of the
      protocol by omitting the wash step enables a further price reduction to
      reach an overall 14-fold cost saving. This method will allow researchers
      to construct more libraries within a given budget, thereby yielding more
      data and facilitating research programs where sequencing large numbers of
      libraries is beneficial.

    title: A scale-dependent measure of system dimensionality
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: A fundamental problem in science is uncovering the effective number of
      dynamical degrees of freedom in a complex system, a quantity that depends
      on the spatio-temporal scale at which the system is observed. Here, we
      propose a scale-dependent generalization of a classic enumeration of
      latent variables, the Participation Ratio. We show how this measure
      relates to conventional quantities such as the Correlation dimension and
      Principal Component Analysis, and demonstrate its properties in dynamical
      systems such as the Lorentz attractor. We apply the method to neural
      population recordings in multiple brain areas and brain states, and
      demonstrate fundamental differences in the effective dimensionality of
      neural activity in behaviorally engaged states versus spontaneous
      activity. Our method applies broadly to multi-variate data across fields
      of science.

      This review was done as part of the SfN Reviewer Mentor Program (Mentor:
      Mike X Cohen, Mentee: Jingwen Li).


      The authors generalized a method of measuring dimensionality, Participation Ratio dimension, to a scale-dependent quantity that captures the dimension at different scales. They verified the quantity on two examples and Gaussian distributions in comparison with the scale-dependent Correlation dimension. They further applied the quantity to different brain regions under different states. I found the methods and results interesting and important, as many complex systems could have dimensionality varying upon the scales. However, my main concern arises when the authors applied the quantity to neural systems. There seems lacking a bridge between the examples and the neural systems analyzed in the study, as well as a clear interpretation of the results. I hope that my comments below will help the authors improve their manuscript.

      1) The definition of distance r is important since the aim of the generalized DPR is to measure dimensionality at different scales. While r used in the examples is spatial distance, the r used in neural system is functional “distance.” It is not clear how these two concepts of distance relate, or whether it is trivial to exchange one for the other. In particular, for the cases where the dimensionality changes with scales (visual cortex, frontal cortex, and midbrain), it’s not clear to me what it means to vary scales in this functional space. Perhaps the authors could include an additional example that validates using spatial, topological, and functional distance measures. This might help the readers smoothly transfer to applications in neural system later in the manuscript. It would also be nice if these examples show different dimensionalities at different scales, as mentioned in discussion.

      2) Relatedly, the interpretation of “dimensionality” in functional space could be more clearly defined. How is this dimensionality related to more commonly used functional metrics like synchronization/noise correlation? For example, as the scale r increases, neurons with a larger functional distance are included, so presumably synchrony of those neurons will decrease. Linking their proposed DPR measure to existing neural synchrony measures (in the four brain regions across two behavioral states) will facilitate a physiological interpretation, and may also help clarify the benefits of DPR. For instance, recent studies found that noise correlation (calculating pairwise correlations of spike counts among neurons) in visual cortex decreases due to locomotion/arousal (Dadarlat & Stryker 2017 J of Neuroscience; Vinck et al 2015 Neuron; Erisken et al 2014 Current Biology). However, the state-dependent decrease of noise correlation is not found in thalamus although firing rate changes with behavioral state (Erisken et al 2014 Current Biology). It would be interesting to compare these findings with the authors’ results in visual cortex and thalamus. This is also interesting because the authors observed lower dimensionality in task-driven states, but active neural processing has been associated with increased synchronization at spatial scales captured by LFP and EEG. Thus, the relationship between dimensionality and synchronization does not seem trivial, and could be very insightful.


      A few minor suggestions:

      1) When using the scale-free Gaussian example, the statement of “systems with such properties are often deemed to be near criticality and are studied in a number of contexts” should be followed by a few citations. Furthermore, it would be helpful if the authors explain how the power law exponent affects the dimensionality in such a system, i.e., the relation of the original Gaussian dimension d and the exponent alpha. This would intuitively explain why DPR saturates at a finite value despite the Gaussian dimension d, although it is derived later by Eq. 5.

      2) In Fig. 1, one of the indices e) is supposed to be d).

      3) In Fig. 3, is data used for b) the same for bottom panels in a), and just rearranged for better presentation? If yes, the authors should indicate in captions of b) for clarification.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    raw_message: The insanity is in thinking that the earth is suddenly flat, and
      that this research paper, done by people outside their specialties with no
      epidemiologists or virologists involved, can overturn all the knowledge we
      have been amassing for over a year. We know, for instance that within
      states, city ordinances change transmission -- and that's all we can
      really talk about when looking at this study. It tries to ask the question
      whether state mandates work to change the mask-wearing and
      distance-keeping behavior of the population, in such a way that the virus
      can be combatted -- or are there enough anti-maskers who refuse to abide,
      who will sabotage public health efforts. So, we know that mask wearing and
      distance-keeping mandates, and more, work at the municipal level to combat
      the virus. We also know, from looking outside the box of just the USA,
      that mandates work when comparing countries to other countries. Let's take
      the case of the phenomen of a couple walking in public, one wearing a
      mask, the other not. The one not masked up has a greater chance of
      contracting the virus, and thus spreading it to the other (and the rest of
      their families), thus negating much of what the masked individual was
      trying to accomplish. We can call this the sabotage factor. In the face of
      the massive amount of information that supports mask wearing, we have to
      really rip this study open to see if it holds the water it pretends to,
      and also, for whatever truth it may hold, what are the social
      implications. The paper simply does not show what many readers would like
      it to show, that the world is flat.

    abstract: The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) has carried out extensive
      rodent toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of radiofrequency radiation
      (RFR) at frequencies and modulations used in the U.S. telecommunications
      industry. This report presents partial findings from these studies. The
      occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed
      to RFR, malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were
      considered of particular interest and are the subject of this report. The
      findings in this report were reviewed by expert peer reviewers selected by
      the NTP and National Institutes of Health (NIH). These reviews and
      responses to comments are included as appendices to this report, and
      revisions to the current document have incorporated and addressed these
      comments. When the studies are completed, they will undergo additional
      peer review before publication in full as part of the NTP's Toxicology and
      Carcinogenesis Technical Reports Series. No portion of this work has been
      submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Supplemental
      information in the form of four additional manuscripts has or will soon be
      submitted for publication. These manuscripts describe in detail the
      designs and performance of the RFR exposure system, the dosimetry of RFR
      exposures in rats and mice, the results to a series of pilot studies
      establishing the ability of the animals to thermoregulate during RFR
      exposures, and studies of DNA damage. (1) Capstick M, Kuster N, Kuhn S,

    title: Sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater anticipates the
      occurrence of COVID-19 cases
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Barcelona sewage long before the
      declaration of the first COVID-19 case, indicating that the infection was
      present in the population before the first imported case was reported.
      Sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater would enable adoption of
      immediate measures in the event of future COVID-19 waves.

    abstract: OASIS-3 is a compilation of MRI and PET imaging and related clinical
      data for 1098 participants who were collected across several ongoing
      studies in the Washington University Knight Alzheimer Disease Research
      Center over the course of 15 years. Participants include 605 cognitively
      normal adults and 493 individuals at various stages of cognitive decline
      ranging in age from 42 to 95 years. The OASIS-3 dataset contains over 2000
      MR sessions, including multiple structural and functional sequences. PET
      metabolic and amyloid imaging includes over 1500 raw imaging scans and the
      accompanying post-processed files from the PET Unified Pipeline (PUP) are
      also available in OASIS-3. OASIS-3 also contains post-processed imaging
      data such as volumetric segmentations and PET analyses. Imaging data is
      accompanied by dementia and APOE status and longitudinal clinical and
      cognitive outcomes. OASIS-3 is available as an open access data set to the
      scientific community to answer questions related to healthy aging and
      dementia.

    abstract: The 1918 influenza pandemic was the deadliest respiratory pandemic of
      the 20th century and determined the genomic make-up of subsequent human
      influenza A viruses (IAV). Here, we analyze the first 1918 IAV genomes
      from Europe and from the first, milder wave of the pandemic. 1918 IAV
      genomic diversity is consistent with local transmission and frequent
      long-distance dispersal events and in vitro polymerase characterization
      suggests potential phenotypic variability. Comparison of first and second
      wave genomes shows variation at two sites in the nucleoprotein gene
      associated with resistance to host antiviral response, pointing at a
      possible adaptation of 1918 IAV to humans. Finally, phylogenetic estimates
      based on extended molecular clock modelling suggests a pure pandemic
      descent of seasonal H1N1 IAV as an alternative to the hypothesis of an
      intrasubtype reassortment origin.

    title: Public Perception of COVID-19 Vaccines through Analysis of Twitter
      Content and Users
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: Twitter is a robust medium to understand wide-scale, organic public
      perception about the COVID-19 vaccine. In this cross-sectional
      observational study, we evaluated 2.4 million English tweets from nearly 1
      million user accounts matching keywords (('covid*' OR 'coronavirus') AND
      'vaccine') during vaccine development from Feb 1st through Dec 11th, 2020.
      We applied topic modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, and demographic
      inference of users on the COVID-19 vaccine related tweets to provide
      insight into the evolution of public attitudes. Individuals generated
      87.9% (n=834,224) of tweets. Of individuals, men (n=560,824) outnumbered
      women (n=273,400) by 2:1 and 39.5% (n=329,776) of individuals were
      [&ge;]40 years old. Daily mean sentiment fluctuated congruent with news
      events, but overall trended positively. Trust, anticipation, and fear were
      the three most predominant emotions; while fear was the most predominant
      emotion early in the study period, trust outpaced fear from April 2020
      onward. Fear was more prevalent in tweets by individuals (26.3% vs.
      organizations 19.4%; p<0.001), specifically among women (28.4% vs. males
      25.4%; p <0.001). Multiple topics had a monthly trend towards more
      positive sentiment. Tweets comparing COVID-19 to the influenza vaccine had
      strongly negative early sentiment but improved over time. Our findings are
      concerning for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, but also identify targets for
      educational interventions.

    title: Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing COVID-19 in the
      working age population - first results from a cohort study in Southern
      Sweden
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Background Vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 needs to be assessed
      in diverse real-world population settings. Methods A cohort study of 805
      741 residents in Scania county, Southern Sweden, aged 18-64 years, of whom
      26 587 received at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Incidence rates
      of COVID-19 were estimated in sex- and age-adjusted analysis and
      stratified in two-week periods with substantial community spread of the
      disease. Results The estimated vaccine effectiveness in preventing
      infection >7 days after second dose was 86% (95% CI 72-94%) but only 42%
      (95% CI 14-63%) >14 days after a single dose. No difference in vaccine
      effectiveness was observed between females and males. Having a prior
      positive test was associated with 91% (95% CI 85 to 94%) effectiveness
      against new infection among the unvaccinated. Conclusion A satisfactory
      effectiveness of BNT162b2 after the second dose was suggested, but with
      possibly substantially lower effect before the second dose.

    title: Gut microbiota may underlie the predisposition of healthy individuals to
      COVID-19
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading globally with high disparity in the
      susceptibility of the disease severity. Identification of the key
      underlying factors for this disparity is highly warranted. Here we
      describe constructing a proteomic risk score based on 20 blood proteomic
      biomarkers which predict the progression to severe COVID-19. We
      demonstrate that in our own cohort of 990 individuals without infection,
      this proteomic risk score is positively associated with proinflammatory
      cytokines mainly among older, but not younger, individuals. We further
      discovered that a core set of gut microbiota could accurately predict the
      above proteomic biomarkers among 301 individuals using a machine learning
      model, and that these gut microbiota features are highly correlated with
      proinflammatory cytokines in another set of 366 individuals. Fecal
      metabolomic analysis suggested potential amino acid-related pathways
      linking gut microbiota to inflammation. This study suggests that gut
      microbiota may underlie the predisposition of normal individuals to severe
      COVID-19.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: Accelerating RepeatClassifier Based on Spark and Greedy Algorithm with
      Dynamic Upper Boundary
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Transposable elements (TEs) represent quantitatively important
      components of genome sequences (e.g. 90% of the wheat genome), and play
      important roles in genome organization and evolution. The promotion of
      unsupervised annotation of transposable elements is of great significance.
      Classification is an important step in TE annotation, which summarize the
      information about the type or mechanism for the raw repetitive sequences.
      RepeatClassifier is a basic homology-based classification tool which
      compares the TE families to both the Repeat Protein Database (DB) and
      libraries of RepeatMasker. Unfortunately, RepeatClassifier is inefficient
      and takes a few days to classify the repetitive sequences of large
      genomes. Hence, we proposed Spark-based RepeatClassifier (SRC) which uses
      Greedy Algorithm with Dynamic Upper Boundary (GDUB) for data division and
      load balancing, and Spark to improve the parallelism of RepeatClassifier.
      Experimental results show that SRC can not only ensure the same level of
      accuracy as that of RepeatClassifier, but also achieve 42-88 times of
      acceleration compared to RepeatClassifier. At the same time, SRC shows
      excellent parallel performance when dealing with input datasets with
      unbalanced length distribution.

    title: "Patterning on the move: the effects of Hh morphogen source movement on
      signaling dynamics"
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: Morphogens of the Hh-family trigger gene expression changes of
      receiving cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The outputs of the
      pathway include regulation of cell identity, proliferation, death or
      metabolism, depending on the tissue or organ. This variety of responses
      relies on a conserved signaling pathway. Its internal logic includes a
      negative feedback loop involving the Hh receptor Ptc. In this paper, we
      use experiments and computational models to study and compare the
      different spatial signaling profiles downstream of Hh in several
      developing Drosophila organs. We show that the spatial distribution of Ptc
      and the activator form of the Gli transcription factor, CiA, in wing,
      antenna and ocellus show similar features, but markedly different from
      that in the compound eye (CE). We show that these two profile types
      represent two time points along the signaling dynamics, and that the
      interplay between the spatial displacement of the Hh source in the CE and
      the negative feedback loop maintains the receiving cells effectively in an
      earlier stage of signaling. These results indicate that the dynamics of
      the Hh source strongly influences the signaling profile Hh elicits in
      receiving cells, and show how the interaction between spatial and temporal
      dynamics of signaling and differentiation processes can contribute to the
      informational versatility of the conserved Hh signaling pathway.

    abstract: >-
      Vaccines based on mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a
      promising new platform used by two leading vaccines against coronavirus
      disease in 2019 (COVID-19). Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations
      present with very high protection levels and varying degrees of side
      effects. However, the nature of the reported side effects remains poorly
      defined. Here we present evidence that LNPs used in many preclinical
      studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal injection of these
      LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by
      massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory
      pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
      The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory
      responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate.


      In summary, here we show that the LNPs used for many preclinical studies are highly inflammatory. Thus, their potent adjuvant activity and reported superiority comparing to other adjuvants in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses could stem from their inflammatory nature. Furthermore, the preclinical LNPs are similar to the ones used for human vaccines, which could also explain the observed side effects in humans using this platform.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

    title: "SIR-PID: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative Controller for COVID-19
      Outbreak Containment"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Ongoing social restrictions, as distancing and lockdown, adopted by
      many countries for contrasting the COVID-19 epidemic spread, try to find a
      trade-off between induced economic crisis, healthcare system collapse and
      costs in terms of human lives. Applying and removing restrictions on a
      system with uncontrollable inertia, as represented by an epidemic
      outbreak, may create critical instabilities, overshoots and strong
      oscillations of infected people around the desirable set-point, defined as
      the maximum number of hospitalizations acceptable by a given healthcare
      system. A good understanding of the system reaction to a change of the
      input control variable can be reasonably achieved using a
      proportional-integral-derivative controller, widely used in technological
      applications. In this paper we make use of this basic control theory for
      understanding the reaction of COVID-19 propagation to social restrictions
      and for exploiting a very known technology to reduce the epidemic damages
      through the correct tuning of the containment policy.

    title: Modeling sequence-space exploration and emergence of epistatic signals in
      protein evolution
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: During their evolution, proteins explore sequence space via an
      interplay between random mutations and phenotypic selection. Here we build
      upon recent progress in reconstructing data-driven fitness landscapes for
      families of homologous proteins, to propose stochastic models of
      experimental protein evolution. These models predict quantitatively
      important features of experimentally evolved sequence libraries, like
      fitness distributions and position-specific mutational spectra. They also
      allow us to efficiently simulate sequence libraries for a vast array of
      combinations of experimental parameters like sequence divergence,
      selection strength and library size. We showcase the potential of the
      approach in re-analyzing two recent experiments to determine protein
      structure from signals of epistasis emerging in experimental sequence
      libraries. To be detectable, these signals require sufficiently large and
      sufficiently diverged libraries. Our modeling framework offers a
      quantitative explanation for the variable success of recently published
      experiments. Furthermore, we can forecast the outcome of time- and
      resource-intensive evolution experiments, opening thereby a way to
      computationally optimize experimental protocols.

    title: Brief exposure of neuronal cells to levels of short chain fatty acids
      observed in human systemic circulation impair the cell lipid metabolism
      resulting in associated cell death by apoptosis
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Communication between gut microbiota and the brain is an enigma.
      Alterations in the gut microbial community affects enteric metabolite
      levels, such as SCFAs. SCFAs have been proposed as a possible mechanism
      through which the gut microbiome modulate brain health and function. This
      study analyzed for the first time the effects of SCFAs at levels reported
      in human systemic circulation on human neuronal cell energy metabolism,
      viability, survival and the brain lipidome. Cell and rat brain lipidomics
      was done using UHPLC-HESI-HRAMS/MS. Neuronal cells viability, survival and
      energy metabolism were analyzed via flow cytometer, immunofluorescence,
      and SeahorseXF platform. Lipidomics analysis demonstrated that SCFAs
      significantly remodeled the brain lipidome in vivo and in vitro. The most
      notable remodulation was observed in the metabolism of
      phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens, and mitochondrial lipids carnitine
      and cardiolipin. Increased mitochondrial mass, fragmentation, and
      hyperfusion occurred concomitant with the altered mitochondrial lipid
      metabolism resulting in decreased neuronal cell respiration, ATP
      production, and increased cell death. This suggests SCFAs at levels
      observed in human systemic circulation can adversely alter the brain
      lipidome and neuronal cell function potentially negatively impacting brain
      health outcomes.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

    title: Enhancing Mask Activity in Dopaminergic Neurons Extends Lifespan in Flies
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) are essential modulators for brain
      functions involving memory formation, reward processing, and decision
      making. Here I demonstrate a novel and important function of the DANs in
      regulating aging and longevity. Overexpressing the putative scaffolding
      protein Mask in two small groups of DANs in flies can significantly extend
      the lifespan in flies and sustain adult locomotor and fecundity at old
      ages. Such a Mask-induced beneficial effect requires dopaminergic
      transmission but cannot be recapitulated by elevating dopamine production
      in the DANs. Independent activation of Gs in the same two groups of DANs
      via the drug-inducible DREADD system also extends fly lifespan, further
      indicating the connection of specific DANs to aging control. The
      Mask-induced lifespan extension appears to depend on the function of Mask
      to regulate microtubule (MT) stability. A structure-function analysis
      demonstrated that the ankyrin repeats domain in the Mask protein is both
      necessary for regulating MT stability (when expressed in muscles and motor
      neurons) and sufficient to prolong longevity (when expressed in the two
      groups of DANs). Furthermore, DAN-specific overexpression of Unc-104 or
      knockdown of p150Glued, two independent interventions previously shown to
      impact MTs dynamics, also extend lifespan in flies. Together these data
      demonstrated a novel DANs-dependent mechanism that, upon neuronal
      cell-type specific tuning of MT dynamics, modulates systemic aging and
      longevity in flies.

      This was a great and very interesting paper to read. The figures were easy
      to read and use of the color was really helpful to visualize the results.
      However, I think that in figure 1D, including a table or figure legend to
      explain what the various colors are in the diagram would be very helpful.
      Also, the paper and figures switch between referring to PAM dopaminergic
      neurons as 0273, which can be a little confusing, so keeping the notation
      consistent would be great. 


      I understand that you overexpress Mask from birth, but would it be possible to let the flies grow up and then induce Mask overexpression to see whether the same phenotype is observed? This could avoid any complications with Mask’s potential role in development and other signaling pathways. Also, exploring what the flies are dying of that Mask overexpression avoids would make your argument of Mask’s role in increasing survivorship stronger. I found it very interesting that increasing microtubule dynamics increased lifespan, but I think that more clearly showing how/why Mask increases microtubule dynamics would strengthen the association between microtubules, Mask, and lifespan. Perhaps including a coimmunoprecipitation to show Mask’s interacting partners or showing how Unc-104 or P150 glued are affected due to Mask overexpression would make this association clearer. 


      It is truly commendable you were able to generate these results on your own, so please keep up the great work! I look forward to reading your future research

    title: "ANTsX: A dynamic ecosystem for quantitative biological and medical
      imaging"
    category: radiology-and-imaging
    abstract: The Advanced Normalizations Tools ecosystem, known as ANTsX, consists
      of multiple open-source software libraries which house top-performing
      algorithms used worldwide by scientific and research communities for
      processing and analyzing biological and medical imaging data. The base
      software library, ANTs, is built upon, and contributes to, the
      NIH-sponsored Insight Toolkit. Founded in 2008 with the highly regarded
      Symmetric Normalization image registration framework, the ANTs library has
      since grown to include additional functionality. Recent enhancements
      include statistical, visualization, and deep learning capabilities through
      interfacing with both the R statistical project (ANTsR) and Python
      (ANTsPy). Additionally, the corresponding deep learning extensions
      ANTsRNet and ANTsPyNet (built on the popular TensorFlow/Keras libraries)
      contain several popular network architectures and trained models for
      specific applications. One such comprehensive application is a deep
      learning analog for generating cortical thickness data from structural
      T1-weighted brain MRI. Not only does this significantly improve
      computational efficiency and provide comparable-to-superior accuracy over
      multiple criteria relative to the existing ANTs pipelines but it also
      illustrates the importance of the comprehensive ANTsX approach as a
      framework for medical image analysis.

    abstract: Genomic profiling has unveiled the molecular subtypes and mutational
      landscape of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, there is a
      knowledge gap on the consistency of gene expression across PDAC tumors
      profiled in independent studies and this limits follow up research. To
      facilitate novel drug target prioritization and biomarker discovery, we
      investigated the most consistently expressed genes in human PDAC. We
      identified ~4,000 genes highly or lowly expressed in at least 4 of 5
      microarrays (adjusted P<0.05) and validated their expression pattern in
      additional datasets, bulk tumor and single-cell RNA sequencing samples.
      Over 50% of the genes were previously uncharacterized in PDAC; many
      correlated with proliferation, metastasis, mutation, tumor grade, and ~41%
      predicted overall survival. We identified 185 high-priority targets
      (notably in cell cycle and glycolysis) whose inhibition suppressed PDAC
      cell viability in multiple RNA interference datasets and these genes
      predicted treatment in mouse models. Our results represent important
      milestone in the quest for mechanisms, drug targets and biomarkers in
      PDAC, and originate from an adaptable analytical concept that can aid
      discovery in other cancers.

    title: A multicentric, randomized, controlled phase III study of centhaquine
      (Lyfaquin(R)) as a resuscitative agent in hypovolemic shock patients
    category: intensive-care-and-critical-care-medicine
    abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Centhaquine (Lyfaquin(R)) showed significant safety and
      efficacy in preclinical and clinical phase I and II studies. METHODS: A
      prospective, multicentric, randomized phase III study was conducted in
      patients with hypovolemic shock having systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
      [&le;]90 mm Hg and blood lactate levels of [&ge;]2 mmol/L. Patients were
      randomized in a 2:1 ratio, 71 patients to the centhaquine group and 34
      patients to the control (saline) group. Every patient received standard of
      care (SOC) and was followed for 28 days. The study drug (normal saline or
      centhaquine (0.01 mg/kg)) was administered in 100 mL of normal saline
      infusion over 1 hour. The primary objectives were to determine changes
      (mean through 48 hours) in SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood
      lactate levels, and base deficit. The secondary objectives included the
      amount of fluids, blood products, vasopressors administered in the first
      48 hours, duration of hospital stay, time in ICU, time on the ventilator
      support, change in patient's Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),
      Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) scores, and the proportion of
      patients with 28-day all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of
      patients and baseline vitals in both groups were comparable. Trauma was
      the cause of hypovolemic shock in 29.41% of control and 47.06% of
      centhaquine, gastroenteritis in 44.12% of control, and 29.41% of
      centhaquine patients. An equal amount of fluids and blood products were
      administered in both groups during the first 48 hours of resuscitation. A
      lesser amount of vasopressors was needed in the first 48 hours of
      resuscitation in the centhaquine group. An increase in SBP from the
      baseline was consistently higher in the centhaquine group than in the
      control. A significant increase in pulse pressure in the centhaquine group
      than the control group suggests improved stroke volume due to centhaquine.
      The shock index was significantly lower in the centhaquine group than
      control from 1 hour (p=0.0320) till 4 hours (p=0.0494) of resuscitation.
      Resuscitation with centhaquine had a significantly greater number of
      patients with improved blood lactate and the base deficit than the control
      group. ARDS and MODS improved with centhaquine, and an 8.8% absolute
      reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality was observed in the centhaquine
      group. CONCLUSION: Centhaquine is a highly efficacious resuscitative agent
      for treating hypovolemic shock. The efficacy of centhaquine in
      distributive shock due to sepsis and COVID-19 is being explored. The study
      protocol (PMZ-2010/CT-3.1/2018) was approved by the Drug Controller
      General of India (DCGI), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government
      of India, and Institutional Ethics Committee of all the 14 Institutions."

    title: "STARsolo: accurate, fast and versatile mapping/quantification of
      single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: We present STARsolo, a comprehensive turnkey solution for quantifying
      gene expression in single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq data, built into RNA-seq
      aligner STAR. Using simulated data that closely resembles realistic
      scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that STARsolo is highly accurate and
      significantly outperforms pseudoalignment-to-transcriptome tools. STARsolo
      can replicate the results of, but is considerably faster than CellRanger,
      currently the most widely used tool for pre-processing scRNA-seq data. In
      addition to uniquely mapped reads, STARsolo takes account of multi-gene
      reads, necessary to detect certain classes of biologically important
      genes. It has a flexible cell barcode processing scheme, compatible with
      many established scRNA-seq protocols, and extendable to emerging
      technologies. STARsolo can quantify transcriptomic features beyond gene
      expression, which we illustrate by analyzing cell-type-specific
      alternative splicing in the Tabula Muris project.

      Hi,


      Thank you very much for posting this preprint.


      I am working on trying to read through the manuscript more carefully, which I hope can improve my understanding of <i>STARsolo</i> as well the regular <i>STAR</i> alignment.  I also thought the different results with varying settings of <i>Alevin</i> was interesting and important.


      However, in the meantime, I believe that you have a minor error in one of your references:


      [30]. R. S. Brüning et al. Comparative Analysis of Common Alignment Tools for Single Cell RNA Sequencing. <u><b>preprint. Bioinformatics</b></u>, 2021. doi: 10.1101/2021.02.15.430948.


      I think this should be a bioRxiv preprint (not a Bioinformatics preprint)?


      For example, the DOI leads to this reference:


      https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.430948v2


      Thanks Again,

      Charles

    title: Loose ends in cancer genome structure
    category: genomics
    abstract: Recent pan-cancer studies have delineated patterns of structural
      genomic variation across thousands of tumor whole genome sequences. It is
      not known to what extent the shortcomings of short read ([&le;] 150 bp)
      whole genome sequencing (WGS) used for structural variant analysis has
      limited our understanding of cancer genome structure. To formally address
      this, we introduce the concept of "loose ends" - copy number alterations
      that cannot be mapped to a rearrangement by WGS but can be indirectly
      detected through the analysis of junction-balanced genome graphs.
      Analyzing 2,319 pan-cancer WGS cases across 31 tumor types, we found loose
      ends were enriched in reference repeats and fusions of the mappable genome
      to repetitive or foreign sequences. Among these we found genomic
      footprints of neotelomeres, which were surprisingly enriched in cancers
      with low telomerase expression and alternate lengthening of telomeres
      phenotype. Our results also provide a rigorous upper bound on the role of
      non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) in large-scale cancer
      structural variation, while nominating INO80, FANCA, and ARID1A as
      positive modulators of somatic NAHR. Taken together, we estimate that
      short read WGS maps >97% of all large-scale (>10 kbp) cancer structural
      variation; the rest represent loose ends that require long molecule
      profiling to unambiguously resolve. Our results have broad relevance for
      future research and clinical applications of short read WGS and delineate
      precise directions where long molecule studies might provide
      transformative insight into cancer genome structure.

      Very catchy title and some quite interesting results. Xiaotong Yao
      suggested I raise my terminology concerns as a biorxiv comment:

      ‘Loose ends’ is a catchy title but I am concerned that the use of new terminology for existing concepts has the potential to confuse readers. The definition you are using for ‘loose ends’ is equivalent to concept of a single breakend variant defined in the VCFv4.1 specifications about a decade ago.
       
      Whilst it is only recently that variant callers have actually explicitly reported VCF single breakends (GRIDSS2 from SR/OEA/breakend assemblies, PURPLE from unexplained CN transitions), the loose end/single breakend concept has a long history of implicit usage. For example, NovelSeq (Sahinalp, 2010) uses an orientation-constrained assembly approach (OEA+/OEA-) very similar to that of jabba to produce what this paper calls loose end assemblies (although what NovelSeq does afterwards is different). The assembly similarity can also be seen in GRIDSS1 which uses the terms ‘breakend assembly’ and ‘anchoring reads’ when discussing it’s separate assemblies of forward/- and backward/+ orientation reads/breaks. Viral integration detection software has a similar history of implicit usage of loose ends/single breakends without explicitly using either terminology (only the recently published VIRUSBreakend uses the term).
       
      In summary, this paper would benefit from briefing mentioning the long history of the loose end concept, and how it has been incorporated into existing tools.
       
      ---

      Some additional thoughts to consider:
       
      One interesting benchmarking comparison you could incorporate is against WEAVER. It also generates junction-balanced breakpoint graphs using integer programming, but its conceptual model does not appear to include single breakends. In my benchmarking (https://doi.org/10.1101/781013, Figure 3), I found that weaver failed badly on some samples and I suspect this was due to missing high copy SVs causing all junction balancing solutions to be terrible (thus reporting unbelievable ASCNs). Comparing to WEAVER (or comparing jabba MIP results with/without single breakend support) would be a good demonstration of how essential single breakend support is to the junction balancing process itself.
       
      > we found that almost half (48%, 12,068 of 25,271) of loose ends arose from Type 0 junctions that were missed during genome-wide analysis”
       
      Is this a consequence of waiting till after SV and CN calling is done before looking for single breakends or due to the choice of caller? Would another SV caller (e.g. manta) reduce this? How many of the single breakends found by jabba can be found by stand-alone single breakend SV calling (e.g. GRIDSS2)? I notice jabba allows a BND style VCF input. Does it support single breakend BND calls?


      Single breakend from SV calling and single breakends unbalanced CN junctions seems very much like they are complementary approaches so combining them should improve the final jabba results. I suspect this will be especially true for complex events as they frequently containing many clustered SVs and accurate copy number determination becomes more difficult the shorter the CN segments become.

    title: A massively parallel reporter assay reveals focused and broadly encoded
      RNA localization signals in neurons
    category: genomics
    abstract: "Asymmetric subcellular localization of mRNA is a common cellular
      phenomenon that is thought to contribute to spatial gene regulation. In
      highly polar neurons, subcellular transcript localization and translation
      are thought to enhance cellular efficiency and timely responses to
      external cues. Although mRNA localization has been observed in many
      tissues and numerous examples of the functional importance of this process
      exist, we still lack a systematic understanding of how the transcript
      sorting machinery works in a sequence-specific manner. Here, we addressed
      these gaps by combining subcellular transcriptomics and rationally
      designed sequence libraries. We developed a massively parallel reporter
      assay (MPRA) for mRNA localization and tested ~50,000 sequences for their
      ability to drive RNA localization to neurites of neuronal cell lines. By
      scanning the 3'UTR of >300 genes we identified many previously unknown
      localization regions and mapped the localization potential of endogenous
      sequences. Our data suggest two ways the localization potential can be
      encoded in the 3'UTR: focused localization motifs and broadly encoded
      localization potential based on small contributions. We identified
      sequence motifs enriched in dendritically localized transcripts and tested
      the potential of these motifs to affect the localization behavior of an
      mRNA. This assay revealed sequence elements with the ability to bias
      localization towards neurite as well as soma. Depletion of RNA binding
      proteins predicted or experimentally shown to bind these motifs abolished
      the effect on localization, suggesting that these motifs act by recruiting
      specific RNA-binding proteins. Based on our dataset we developed machine
      learning models that accurately predict the localization behavior of novel
      sequences. Testing this predictor on native mRNA sequencing data showed
      good agreement between predicted and observed localization potential,
      suggesting that the rules uncovered by our MPRA also apply to the
      localization of native transcripts. Applying similar systematic
      high-throughput approaches to other cell types will open the door for a
      comparative perspective on RNA localization across tissues and reveal the
      commonalities and differences of this crucial regulatory mechanism."

      Summary:

      This manuscript by Mikl, M., et al, aims to understand how RNA transcript subcellular localization signals are encoded in 3’ UTR sequences. To this end, the authors designed an MPRA to test thousands of 3’ UTR sequences in parallel. The authors transfect the library to neural cells grown in microporous membranes which allows them to separate the soma from the neurites and subsequently sequence the transcripts in each. The results from the MPRA demonstrate that only a subset of transcripts are enriched in the soma or neurites fractions and localization signals encoded in the 3’ UTR are sufficient to drive transcript localization. The authors then validate a subset of their enriched transcripts via smFISH demonstrating their MPRA mimics endogenous transcript localization. The authors proceed to analyze the sequence of enriched transcripts via mutagenesis and insertions which elucidates that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) largely prevent localization of transcripts to neurites. The authors then follow up their investigations with the creation and validation of longer, novel synthetic 3’UTR sequences capable of neurite enrichment, with subsequent biochemical pulldowns of cell lysates identifying RBP’s necessary for localization. Utilizing their vast dataset of 3’UTR localizing motifs, the authors generated two computational models, one trained on known RBP binding sites and the other assessing all possible sets of 4mers within the sequence, that could successfully predict the localization behavior of unseen 3’UTRs through the estimation of the combined contributions of multiple individual directing sequence elements.


      The major success of this manuscript is in the development of a high-throughput assay to elucidate 3’ UTR encoded transcript localization signals and generation of machine learning models that predict subcellular transcript localization. Overall, we think this manuscript is of high impact and relevance to understand the mechanisms underlying mRNA transcript localization. 


      Below are the major and minor points that should be addressed before the manuscript is published to aid interpretation. 


      Major Points:

      A major concern we have is that the authors mention previous transcript localization studies have very little overlap on enriched dendritically localized transcripts. The authors attributed the lack of overlap to different experimental set ups and cell-types used.  Therefore, the manuscript would be improved by adding a brief explanation as to how their experimental set up and cell types used contrast with previous methods and why their approach might be a better method to identify localization signals encoded in the RNA transcripts. Is there any agreement with previous studies that shed light on biases of the different approaches? Comments on these points will assure readers of the broader significance of their findings and not just the cell type used in the study. 


      Reasoning for the cell type used (CAD and Neuro2a cells) is not explained until the discussion and when mentioned it is not very clear. The manuscript would benefit from a brief explanation of cell type choice when authors explain the final library is transfected into CAD and Neuro2a cells in the results section. 
       
      Regarding the differentiation protocol of Neuro2a and CAD cells, the authors mention in the methods section that they induced differentiation via serum starvation to differentiate cells into a “more neuron-like phenotype”. However, they do not specify at what day post-differentiation the MPRA experiment is done. Consider adding the day of differentiation assays are done. Also,  the manuscript would greatly benefit from IF, qPCR, or WB for neuronal markers to know the cell-type population used in this study, as transcriptional control is largely cell-type dependent. 


      Minor Points:

      Not clear if or how the author's account for the effects differential expression of transcripts and transfection of constructs might have on their output library. 


      Figure 1A: The experimental outline can be improved to aid the reader understand the library design. The construct used in the library could be edited to include what promoter is upstream of GFP, GFP, the 12 nucleotide barcode, the 150 nucleotide sequence, and the pA-site.



      When the authors test the hypothesis that localization potential in RNA is broadly encoded in the 3’ UTR they refer to the experimental setup from Taliaferro et al., 2016 (second line on page 7). To make the experiments clearer for researchers across fields, we suggest adding a brief explanation of the experimental set up. 


      Figure 2: This figure could be improved by re-organizing the order of the panels such that it is easier for the redear to follow the panels from A to F. 
       
      Figure 2D: Not entirely clear why they include St6gal1 on figure 2D without mentioning in the text. We suggest adding a sentence explanation in the main text. 


      Figure 2D and 2E: For smFISH images and quantification, was there a control construct with just GFP? If data is available, the authors should show the image of the ‘normal’ distribution of GFP and then use it as a normalization control for their quantification on 2E. 
       
      Figure 2: No example graph of a broadly encoded transcript is included. Since this is a major conclusion from the paper we suggest the graph to be moved from the supplementary figures to figure 2.  


      In the main text when authors explain the broadly encoded signals might have “many small contributions making up the net localization behavior” it is not clear what they mean by that. A brief explanation of what “small contributions” could be will help make their results more clear to the reader. 


      For RNAi experiments, it is not clear the extent of knockdown for targets as qRT-PCR data mentioned in the methods section is not presented. The qRT-PCR data should be included in the supplementary figures.


      When AGGUA is inserted 1 to 4 times (5th line on page 9) Where is the sequence inserted (at what position(s), throughout the transcript, one after another, etc.)?


      After the knockdown experiments the authors state that “Dazap1 is one mechanism underlying soma enrichment”. To ascertain this is the mechanism responsible for retention of transcripts in the soma, the knockdown experiments could benefit by the addition of rescuing DAzap1 and see if that rescues the negative effect. 


      It is unclear as to how the MEME Suite generates the de novo synthetic sequences, how many were generated, and what was the range in sequence lengths. A brief, yet more explicit description in the main text of how these synthetic sequences were generated and then ‘introduced in native contexts’, e.g. were they added to the end/beginning/within existing 3’UTRs, would help the reader better understand your experimentation.


      Figure 4B and 4C: The vast majority of the synthetic motifs appear to be shifted towards more negative logFC’s indicating increased soma localization. While the success of SU1 is impressive, the low replicability should be mentioned as a caveat in the main text and it’s potential causes speculated upon in the discussion.


      The analysis of the proteomics data should be better explained either within the text or figure captions. Figures 5B, 5D, and 5E are very difficult to understand without any explanation as to how to interpret them in the text. 


      Figure 5: It appears that the plots in Figure 5D and 5E have been switched based on their references in the main text.


      The font size of Figure 5C, 5D, and 5E is much too small to be legible and easily understood.


      Figure 5F: It would greatly help with clarity for the meaning of the red vertical line to be indicated within the plot itself and not solely within the figure caption as it is vital for data interpretation.


      Consider adding more background into why Celf1 and Celf6 were chosen for validation over the other 23 identified proteins. It would be valuable to state the known, or utilize experimentation to determine, the pathway by which these proteins binding to the 3’UTR shuttles them to the neurite. In other words, what is the entire mechanism for neurite localization, not just the identity of the RBP. 


      There is an inconsistency in the spelling of ‘4mer’ (as spelled in the main text and caption) and ‘fourmer’ as it appears in Figure 6A. There is also never a direct definition of what the 4mers are and what information they convey to the computational model. 


      Some speculation into the power of your computational model would be helpful in the determination of its use in future projects. How might further iterations and optimizations be done to improve the auROC?

    title: Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and intra-host evolution in association
      with advanced HIV infection
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: While most people effectively clear SARS-CoV-2, there are several
      reports of prolonged infection in immunosuppressed individuals. Here we
      present a case of prolonged infection of greater than 6 months with the
      shedding of high titter SARS-CoV-2 in an individual with advanced HIV and
      antiretroviral treatment failure. Through whole-genome sequencing at
      multiple time points, we demonstrate the early emergence of the E484K
      substitution associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies, followed
      by other escape mutations and the N501Y substitution found in most
      variants of concern. This provides support to the hypothesis of intra-host
      evolution as one mechanism for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with
      immune evasion properties.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    abstract: Departing from classical rule-based linguistic models, advances in
      deep learning have led to the development of a new family of
      self-supervised deep language models (DLMs). These models are trained
      using a simple self-supervised autoregressive objective, which aims to
      predict the next word in the context of preceding words in real-life
      corpora. After training, autoregressive DLMs are able to generate new
      'context-aware' sentences with appropriate syntax and convincing semantics
      and pragmatics. Here we provide empirical evidence for the deep connection
      between autoregressive DLMs and the human language faculty using a 30-min
      spoken narrative and electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings.
      Behaviorally, we demonstrate that humans have a remarkable capacity for
      word prediction in natural contexts, and that, given a sufficient context
      window, DLMs can attain human-level prediction performance. Next, we
      leverage DLM embeddings to demonstrate that many electrodes spontaneously
      predict the meaning of upcoming words, even hundreds of milliseconds
      before they are perceived. Finally, we demonstrate that contextual
      embeddings derived from autoregressive DLMs capture neural representations
      of the unique, context-specific meaning of words in the narrative. Our
      findings suggest that deep language models provide an important step
      toward creating a biologically feasible computational framework for
      generative language.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    raw_message: It's heartbreaking to me that all those hundreds, perhaps
      thousands, of NYC patients in the spring of 2020 were left to sit around
      at home until they could barely breath and were then hospitalized and put
      on ventilators, and were denied HCQ, which may have saved hundreds of
      lives.  Truly sickening, imo.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    raw_message: This would coincide with virtually all other RNA respiratory
      viruses studied.  I am surprised that the initial instinct seems to be
      resistant to recognizing that natural immunity would be inferior to
      induced immunity when we have no precedent to suggest that would be the
      case.

      6 months post covid and I refuse to get vaccinated when my antibody test
      came in at over 300--I never wear a mask and I don't social distance.

      it's possible, but not relevant.  Control for behavior of the subjects
      would be true of all--yes or no previously infected, yes or no vaccinated,
      yes or no both; maybe they all changed their behavior, maybe some a
      little, maybe some no change, it matters not the the point of the
      study.  Furthermore your characterization of "the low rate of
      re-infection" shows your unexplained bias.  It wasn't "low" IT WAS ZERO.

      NOT ONE SUBJECT, PREVIOUSLY INFECTED, HAD A RE-INFECTION.

      This is consistent with all history of coronavirus infections, and viral infections in general.  Even after antibodies have subsided, they will re-surge when presented with the virus at a later date--even many decades.

      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus causing the ongoing pandemic which
      already led to >129 millions of infections and >2.8 millions of deaths.
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been shown to own promising potential in
      clinically combating SARS-CoV-2 but the underlying mechanisms remain
      highly elusive and its action sites were proposed all on the host cells.
      Very recently, by NMR spectroscopy, for the first time we have decoded
      that HCQ specifically binds both N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal
      domain (CTD) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein to inhibit their
      interactions with nucleic acids (NAs), as well as to disrupt its
      NA-induced liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) essential for the viral
      life cycle including the final package of gRNA and N protein into new
      virions. Here with NMR-derived constraints, we constructed the structure
      of the HCQ-CTD complex in which HCQ binds two pockets on the dimeric CTD.
      This unexpected finding thus allowed us to formulate a design strategy by
      linking two HCQ together to generate a bivalent/multivalent binder for
      CTD. The linked molecule is anticipated to have significantly enhanced
      affinity and specificity in binding CTD. We are willing to collaborate
      with synthetic chemists on this strategy by experimentally charactering
      the synthetic molecules on their binding and effects on LLPS of SARS-CoV-2
      N protein.

      individuals who were previously infected and unvaccinated, I question that
      this study has enough statistical power to support the bold claims in the

      More at play than precautions. It shouldn’t be a surprise that natural
      antibodies protect against the disease…they are antibodies after all. The
      question will be, “how long do natural antibodies last vs those generated
      by the vaccine?”

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: Novel zebrafish mutants reveal new roles for Apolipoprotein B during
      embryonic development and pathological conditions
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: "Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is the primary protein of chylomicrons, VLDLs
      and LDLs and is essential for their assembly. Defects in ApoB synthesis
      and secretion result in several human diseases, including
      abetalipoproteinemia and familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. Conversely,
      high levels of APOB in plasma are associated with increased risk for
      coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. The involvement of APOB in
      lipid metabolism and atherogenesis prompted the generation of several
      mutant mice. However, as APOB is required for supplying nutrients to the
      developing embryo, ApoB null mice are embryonic lethal, thereby precluding
      the study of the roles of this protein during development. Here, we
      established novel zebrafish mutants for two apoB genes: apoBa and apoBb.1.
      Double-mutant embryos display hepatic steatosis, a common hallmark of
      FHBL1 and NAFLD. In addition, we detect early developmental defects in
      double apoB mutants, including abnormal liver laterality, decreased
      numbers of goblet cells in the gut and impaired angiogenesis. We further
      use these models to identify the domains within ApoB responsible for its
      functions. By assessing the ability of different truncated forms of human
      APOB to rescue the mutant phenotypes, we demonstrate the benefits of this
      model for prospective therapeutic screens. Overall, our novel zebrafish
      models uncover new functions of ApoB in organ development and
      morphogenesis and shed new light on the mechanisms underlying
      hypolipidemia-related diseases."

      For Figure 2, no WT shown which would be good for a reference. In 2C, it
      is unclear what is happening. A suggestion is to zoom out for a better
      image or do a zoomed out pic with a zoomed in figure beside it.
      Additionally, are both prox1a and tfa necessary? One subfigure could
      potentially be put in supplemental. Labels for arrows would also be
      helpful for 2D, F, and H. There also appears to be an inconsistency with
      dpf in the figure. Is the prox1a expression gone by 4 dpf? The reasoning
      for only showing 2 dpf might be needed. Concerning Figure 2F, a suggestion
      is to have a graph show foxa2 expression over time (1.5 dpf to 2.5 dpf).
      There also seems to be a resolution issue throughout the figure. A
      potential fix would be for 2F, to possibly trace it. To support claim and
      significance, we would also like to see more animals and different time
      points.


      A potential future experiment could be the use of an organoid.


      Moreover, I understand that the main idea of the paper is prove that zebrafish can be used as model system by conducting the experiments in various organ systems. But I believe that this point is kind of understand and people would normally get lost in the details of the figure and forget why you conducted experiments in different organ systems. Therefore, for this it would be better to mention and repeat it so that we understand the reason for the transition.

    title: The structure and spontaneous curvature of clathrin lattices at the
      plasma membrane.
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: >-
      Clathrin mediated endocytosis is the primary pathway for receptor and
      cargo internalization in eukaryotic cells. It is characterized by a
      polyhedral clathrin lattice that coats budding membranes. The mechanism
      and control of lattice assembly, curvature, and vesicle formation at the
      plasma membrane has been a matter of longstanding debate. Here, we use
      platinum replica and cryo electron microscopy and tomography to present a
      global structural framework of the pathway. We determine the shape and
      size parameters common to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that
      clathrin sites maintain a constant surface area during curvature across
      multiple cell lines. Flat clathrin is present in all cells and
      spontaneously curves into coated pits without additional energy sources or
      recruited bending factors. Finally, we attribute curvature generation to
      loosely connected and pentagon-containing flat lattices that can rapidly
      curve when a flattening force is released. Together, these data present a
      new universal mechanistic model of clathrin mediated endocytosis.

    title: Neutralization against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 with sera of COVID-19
      recovered cases and vaccinees of BBV152
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Recently, multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants have been detected across the
      globe.The recent emergence of B.1.617 lineage has created serious public
      health problem in India. The high transmissibility was observed with this
      lineage which has led to daily increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2
      infections. Apparently, the sub-lineage B.1.617.2 has slowly dominated the
      other variants including B1617.1, B.617.3 and B.1.1.7. With this, World
      Health Organization has described B.1.617.2 as variant of concern. Besides
      this, variant of concern B.1.351 has been also reported from India, known
      to showreducedefficacyfor many approved vaccines. With the increasing
      threat of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is imperative to assess the efficacy
      of the currently available vaccines against these variants. Here, we have
      evaluated the neutralization potential of sera collected from COVID-19
      recovered cases (n=20) and vaccinees with two doses of BBV152 (n=17)
      against B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 compared to the prototype B.1 (D614G)
      variant.The finding of the study demonstrated a reduction in
      neutralization titers with sera of COVID-19 recovered cases(3.3-fold and
      4.6-fold) and BBV152 vaccinees (3. 0 and 2.7 fold) against B.1.351 and
      B.1.617.2 respectively. Although, there is reduction in neutralization
      titer, the whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152)
      demonstrates protective response against VOC B.1351 and B.1.617.2.

    category: neuroscience

    abstract: Nociceptors are specialized sensory neurons that detect damaging or
      potentially damaging stimuli and are found in the dorsal root (DRG) and
      trigeminal ganglia. These neurons are critical for the generation of
      neuronal signals that ultimately create the perception of pain. These
      neurons are also primary targets for acute and chronic pain therapeutics.
      Single-cell transcriptomics on mouse nociceptors has transformed our
      understanding of pain mechanisms. We sought to generate equivalent
      information for human nociceptors with the goal of identifying
      transcriptomic signatures of nociceptors, identifying species differences
      and elucidating new drug targets. We used spatial transcriptomics to
      molecularly characterize transcriptomes of single dorsal root ganglion
      (DRG) neurons from 8 organ donors. We identified 12 clusters of human
      sensory neurons, 5 of which are C nociceptors; as well as 1 Abeta;
      nociceptor, 2 Adelta;, 2 Abeta; and 1 proprioceptor subtypes. By focusing
      on expression profiles for ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors
      (GPCRs) and other pharmacological targets, we provide a rich map of drug
      targets in the human DRG with direct comparison to mouse sensory neuron
      transcriptomes. We also compare human DRG neuronal subtypes to non-human
      primates showing conserved patterns of gene expression among many cell
      types, but divergence among specific nociceptor subsets. Finally, we
      identify sex differences in human DRG subpopulation transcriptomes,
      including a marked increase in CALCA expression in female pruritogen
      receptor enriched nociceptors. Our data open the door to development of
      drug discovery programs for new pain targets and unparalleled molecular
      characterization of clinical sensory disorders.

    title: Brain charts for the human lifespan
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Over the past 25 years, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in
      basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, there are
      no reference standards against which to anchor measures of individual
      differences in brain morphology, in contrast to growth charts for traits
      such as height and weight. Here, we built an interactive online resource
      (www.brainchart.io) to quantify individual differences in brain structure
      from any current or future magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, against
      models of expected age-related trends. With the goal of basing these on
      the largest and most inclusive dataset, we aggregated MRI data spanning
      115 days post-conception through 100 postnatal years, totaling 122,123
      scans from 100,071 individuals in over 100 studies across 6 continents.
      When quantified as centile scores relative to the reference models,
      individual differences show high validity with non-MRI brain growth
      estimates and high stability across longitudinal assessment. Centile
      scores helped identify previously unreported brain developmental
      milestones and demonstrated increased genetic heritability compared to
      non-centiled MRI phenotypes. Crucially for the study of brain disorders,
      centile scores provide a standardised and interpretable measure of
      deviation that reveals new patterns of neuroanatomical differences across
      neurological and psychiatric disorders emerging during development and
      ageing. In sum, brain charts for the human lifespan are an essential first
      step towards robust, standardised quantification of individual variation
      and for characterizing deviation from age-related trends. Our global
      collaborative study provides such an anchorpoint for basic neuroimaging
      research and will facilitate implementation of research-based standards in
      clinical studies.

    title: PRDM9 losses in vertebrates are coupled to the loss of at least three
      other meiotic genes
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: "In most mammals and likely throughout vertebrates, the gene PRDM9
      specifies the locations of meiotic double strand breaks; in mice and
      humans at least, it also aids in their repair. For both roles, many of the
      molecular partners remain unknown. Here, we take a phylogenetic approach
      to identify genes that may be interacting with PRDM9, by leveraging the
      fact that PRDM9 arose before the origin of vertebrates, but was lost many
      times, either partially or entirely--and with it, its role in
      recombination. As a first step, we characterize PRDM9 domain composition
      across 379 vertebrate species, inferring at least eight independent
      losses. We then use the interdigitation of PRDM9 orthologs across
      vertebrates to test whether it co-evolved with any of 241 candidate genes
      co-expressed with PRDM9 in mice or associated with recombination
      phenotypes in mammals. Accounting for the phylogenetic relationship among
      species, we identify three genes whose presence and absence is
      unexpectedly coincident with that of PRDM9: ZCWPW1, which was recently
      shown to be recruited to sites of PRDM9 binding and to facilitate double
      strand break repair; TEX15, which has also been suggested to play a role
      in repair; and ZCWPW2, the paralog of ZCWPW1. ZCWPW2 is expected to be
      recruited to sites of PRDM9 binding as well; its tight coevolution with
      PRDM9 across vertebrates suggests that it is a key interactor, with a role
      either in recruiting the recombination machinery or in double strand break
      repair."

      this change."

    title: "Preprints in motion: tracking changes between posting and journal
      publication"
    category: scientific-communication-and-education
    abstract: Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, preprints in the biomedical sciences are
      being posted and accessed at unprecedented rates, drawing widespread
      attention from the general public, press and policymakers for the first
      time. This phenomenon has sharpened longstanding questions about the
      reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the
      information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer
      review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We
      assessed preprints that had been posted and subsequently published in a
      journal between 1st January and 30th April 2020, representing the initial
      phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and
      manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the
      preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure
      panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles.
      Moreover, the conclusions of 6% of non-COVID-19-related and 15% of
      COVID-19-related abstracts undergo a discrete change by the time of
      publication, but the majority of these changes do not reverse the main
      message of the paper.

    title: "Safety and Potency of COVIran Barekat Inactivated Vaccine Candidate for
      SARS-CoV-2: A Preclinical Study"
    category: immunology
    abstract: There is an urgent demand to manufacture an effective and safe vaccine
      to prevent SARS-CoV2 infection, which resulted in a global pandemic. In
      this study, we developed an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 candidate
      vaccine named COVIran Barekat. Immunization at two different doses (3
      microgram or 5 microgram per dose) elicited a high level of SARS-CoV-2
      specific neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits, and non-human primates.
      The results show the safety profile in studied animals (include guinea
      pig, rabbit, mice, and monkeys). Rhesus macaques were immunized with the
      two-dose of 5 microgram and microgram of the COVIran Barekat vaccine and
      showed highly efficient protection against 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2
      intratracheal challenge compared with the control group. These results
      highlight the COVIran Barekat vaccine as a potential candidate to induce a
      strong and potent immune response which may be a promising and feasible
      vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

    title: Heightened condition dependent expression of structural colouration in
      the faces, but not wings, of male and female flies
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Structurally coloured sexual signals are a conspicuous and widespread
      class of ornament used in mate choice, though the extent to which they
      encode information on the quality of their bearers is not fully resolved.
      Theory predicts that signalling traits under strong sexual selection as
      honest indicators should evolve to be more developmentally integrated and
      exaggerated than nonsexual traits, thereby leading to heightened condition
      dependence. Here we test this prediction through examination of the
      sexually dimorphic faces and wings of the cursorial fly Lispe cana. Males
      and females possess structural UV-white and golden faces, respectively,
      and males present their faces and wings to females during close-range,
      ground-based courtship displays, thereby creating the opportunity for
      mutual inspection. Across a field-collected sample of individuals, we
      found that the appearance of the faces of both sexes scaled positively
      with individual condition, though along separate axes. Males in better
      condition expressed brighter faces as modelled according to conspecific
      flies, whereas condition scaled with facial saturation in females. We
      found no such relationships for their wing interference pattern nor
      abdomens, with the latter included as a nonsexual control. Our results
      suggest that the structurally coloured faces, but not the iridescent
      wings, of male and female Lispe cana are reliable guides to individual
      quality and support the broader potential for structural colours as honest
      signals. They also highlight the potential for mutual mate choice in this
      system, while arguing for one of several alternate signalling roles for
      wing interferences patterns among the myriad taxa which bear them.

    title: Breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2 and its predictors among
      healthcare workers in a medical college and hospital complex in Delhi,
      India
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: >-
      IntroductionThe study objective was to determine the breakthrough
      infection rate of Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in those vaccinated with
      either BBV152 or AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) vaccine among healthcare workers
      (HCWs).


      MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was conducted a medical college and hospital complex in Delhi, India through telephonic interviews among HCWs who had received at-least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine during January to March 2021. Breakthrough infections were operationally defined as occurrence of Covid-19 infection [&ge;]14 days after administration of two doses of either Covid-19 vaccine.


      ResultsWe enrolled 326 HCWs with mean (SD) age of 29.1 (85.9) years including 212 (65%) males. Two hundred eighty (90.9%) HCWs were fully vaccinated while 46 (14.1%) were partially vaccinated. There were 168 (51.5%) BBV152 and 158 (48.5%) AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) recipients.


      A total of 36 (11%, 95% C.I. 8.1, 14.9) breakthrough infections were reported in the HCWs. The median (IQR) time until incidence of Covid-19 infection since receiving second dose of either Covid-19 vaccine was 46 (28.2, 54.7) days. Furthermore, Covid-19 infections occurred in 65 (19.9%, 95% C.I 15.9, 24.6) HCWs vaccinated with at-least one dose of vaccine but prior to receiving their second dose or <14 days post second dose. Most breakthrough infection cases (94.4%) were mild and did not require supplemental oxygen therapy. HCWs with past history of natural Covid-19 infection with recovery were 4.5 times less likely to experience a Covid-19 infection after partial vaccination.


      ConclusionNearly one in nine HCWs experienced a Covid-19 breakthrough infection in the present study.

      1. Do you know if the relative lack of severe manifestations among the
      vaccinees with breakthrough covid 19 was associated with the occurrence of
      prior Covid 19 infection before undergoing vaccination?

      2. Do you have data  on the demographics of the vaccinee recipients, especially risk factors for severe disease and age because it would be interesting to know if the vaccine truly mitigated the severity of disease or the vaccinated population is younger and healthier than most being health care workers.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    abstract: We present a comprehensive statistical framework to analyze data from
      genome-wide association studies of polygenic traits, producing distinct
      and interpretable discoveries while controlling the false discovery rate.
      This approach leverages sophisticated multivariate models, correcting for
      linkage disequilibrium, and accounts for population structure and
      relatedness, adapting to the characteristics of the samples at hand. A key
      element is the recognition that the observed genotypes can be considered
      as a random sample from an appropriate model, encapsulating our knowledge
      of genetic inheritance and human populations. This allows us to generate
      imperfect copies (knockoffs) of these variables which serve as ideal
      negative controls; knockoffs are indistinguishable from the original
      genotypes in distribution, and independent from the phenotype. In sharp
      contrast with state-of-the-art methods, the validity of our inference in
      no way depends on assumptions about the unknown relation between genotypes
      and phenotype. We develop and leverage a model for the genotypes that
      accounts for arbitrary and unknown population structure, which may be due
      to diverse ancestries or familial relatedness. We build a pipeline that is
      robust to the most prominent possible confounders, facilitating the
      discovery of causal variants. Validity and effectiveness are demonstrated
      by extensive simulations with real data, as well as by the analysis of
      several phenotypes in the UK Biobank. Finally, fast software is made
      available for researchers to apply the proposed methodology to
      Biobank-scale data sets.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      The statistical analysis is invalid suffering from an very clear immortal
      time bias. This is really basic stats 101.  There is a reason this
      pre-print has not been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal.  


      For a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, groups need to be defined at baseline.  For persons to have received >80 mg/kg cumulative HCQ dosing (where a standard 600mg dose could is ~8mg/kg/day), persons need to survive for 10 days.  So Figure 2, compares those who survive to receive 10 days of HCQ versus all others  This is an immortal time bias. 


      As 88% of people overall received HCQ, likely a large proportion of those 40% who died before day 10 received HCQ (at max only ~12% could not have received HCQ).
       
      The authors should re-do their analysis using a Cox-regression with a time-dependent covariate for receiving HCQ.

      Stephen, can you assure that not even around 7 out of the 224 patients to
      whom were given HCQ did get included in the "success" group by cumulative
      dosages (the 18 survivors that took >3g HCQ + >1g AZM) JUST BECAUSE they
      survived and therefore had more time to consolidate those dosages, and not
      the other way around?


      Because if that is the case, I believe you got a problem of statistical significance. That would leave us with just 3 survivors above general average. And by 7 out of 224, that might be the case.


      Another issue: 87% of all patients received HCQ in some form but what was the percentage of those in the survivors group? I couldn't find the number but I suspect this result is something to look at. It should be higher than 87% if any form of it works in any way. As is also something to look at the randomized double blinded studies that compare those who took HCQ+AZM to those who didn't, in a more broad way, so that we can compare the effects. I suspect that this study not being blinded or double blinded could have also skewed the results by some amount, and that is another issue.


      One more issue: I find it quite weird that you had 78% death rate when the average north american death rate for intubated patients of covid is around 46% for what I've seen. Even using a few medications that supposedly work. There must be something else at play here, probably also skewing the results.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    abstract: Gadolinium is a key component of magnetic resonance imaging contrast
      agents that are critical tools for enhanced detection and diagnosis of
      tissue and vascular abnormalities. Untargeted post-injection deposition of
      gadolinium in vivo, and association with diseases like nephrogenic
      systemic fibrosis, has alerted regulatory agencies to re-evaluate their
      widespread use and generated calls for safer gadolinium-based contrast
      agents (GBCAs). Increasing anthropogenic gadolinium in surface water has
      also raised concerns of potential bioaccumulation in plants and animals.
      Methylotrophic bacteria can acquire, transport, store and use light
      lanthanides as part of a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone
      (PQQ), an essential component of XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs),
      a critical enzyme for methylotrophic growth with methanol. We report
      robust gadolinium-dependent methanol growth of a genetic variant of
      Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, named evo-HLn, for evolved for heavy
      lanthanides. Genetic adaptation of evo-HLn resulted in increased xox1
      promoter and XoxF MDH activities, transport and storage of Gd3+, and
      augmented biosynthesis of PQQ. Gadolinium-grown cells exhibited a shorter
      T1 relaxation time compared to cells with lanthanum or no lanthanide when
      analyzed by MRI. In addition, evo-HLn was able to grow on methanol using
      the GBCA Gd-DTPA as the sole gadolinium source, showing the potential of
      this strain for the development of novel GBCAs and gadolinium recovery
      from medical waste and/or wastewater.

      So far some experts are looking at no significant signs of decrease after
      a solid 10 months, meanwhile there are still some talks about vax boosters
      possibly being needed due to noted drops in antibodies from the vaccine
      after 6-8 months.


      If I can find the link to that article again I'll post it back here for you.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      A couple of things people really need to note here:

      1) This is PRE-publication. It hasn't been peer-reviewed. Everything on this website is such. It cannot be regarded the same as something which has gone through the full process with a respected journal.

      2) This is an observational study (retrospective cohort). It is NOT a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Only the RCT can prove causation. This is hypothesis-generating research only. It does not PROVE HCQ works, merely suggests that. 


      3) If you dig in a bit, they define "treatment" to include only 37 of the advertised 250ish patients in the cohort, specifically those receiving >3,000mg HCQ and >1g azithromycin. Small sample sizes should always be viewed with extreme skepticism. Less than 30ish and your p-value is essentially meaningless. 


      4) The overall mortality rate of the total group was ~80%! These people were old, unhealthy to begin with, admitted to the hospital after nearly a week of progressing symptoms, required ICU care, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. These were very sick patients.


      5) Clinically, we see a pattern for the treatment of ARDS and secondary pneumonia, not COVID. High dose corticosteroids work (we know this for ARDS), tocilizumab, a potent anti-inflammatory works (we have some data for this in ARDS as well). And azithromycin is a very common drug to treat bacterial pneumonias that often pop up secondary to lung disease like this.



      So, please avoid jumping to unsupported conclusions. If we want real answers, we have to keep our skepticism, and be very careful in our analysis. The key here is we need corroborating studies. An April 2020 study at the VA showed exactly the opposite effect of HCQ in a similar patient population (though the VA obviously serves more males).

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    raw_message: Where to begin? 1) This is an abstract; not yet peer reviewed; so
      it's just four guys saying this.  2)They don't say how they got their
      population.  3) They provide no data.  4) There is no control group either
      randomized, case control, or cohort. 5) They really do not specify their
      methods.  6) There is no treatment protocol so we don't know what
      additional treatment they may have received.   Overall this doesn't meet
      any scientific standard.  But even if it had been well done;  these
      patients presented in the Spring of 2020 when treatment protocols were
      very different and outcomes much worse.  This study says nothing about
      whether HCQ would be of any benefit to patients receiving treatment in
      Spring 2021.

    raw_message: I see no indication of how many patients received the high doses of
      hydroxychloroquine and zinc, so it is impossible to tell how meaningful
      the results are.  If 78.2% of the 255 patients died, that leaves only 55
      or 56 who survived.  Is the increased survival rate a function of the
      small number phenomenon, the drug regimen, both, neither?

    abstract: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) with mutations
      in key neutralizing antibody epitopes threatens to undermine vaccines
      developed against the pandemic founder variant (Wu-Hu-1). Widespread
      vaccine rollout and continued transmission are creating a population that
      has antibody responses of varying potency to Wu-Hu-1. Against this
      background, it is critical to assess the outcomes of subsequent
      immunization with variant antigens. It is not yet known whether
      heterotypic vaccine boosts would be compromised by original antigenic sin,
      where pre-existing responses to a prior variant dampen responses to a new
      one, or whether the primed memory B cell repertoire would bridge the gap
      between Wu-Hu-1 and VOCs. Here, we show that a single adjuvanted dose of
      receptor binding domain (RBD) protein from VOC 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) drives an
      extremely potent neutralizing antibody response capable of
      cross-neutralizing both Wu-Hu-1 and 501Y.V2 in rhesus macaques previously
      immunized with Wu-Hu-1 spike protein. Passive immunization with plasma
      sampled following this boost protected K18-hACE2 mice from lethal
      challenge with a 501Y.V2 clinical isolate, whereas only partial protection
      was afforded by plasma sampled after two Wu-Hu-1 spike immunizations.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      Below is an excerpt from the full text stating that the purpose of the
      study was to prove that it was beneficial for the previously infected to
      still receive the vaccine.  Thankfully the researchers had the ethics to
      report that they found the opposite of what they purposed to find.


      "A strong case for vaccinating previously infected persons can be made if it can be shown that previously infected persons who are vaccinated have a lower incidence of COVID-19 than previously infected persons who did not receive the vaccine.


      The purpose of this study was to attempt to do just that,"

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    title: Transcriptomic analysis of temporal shifts in berry development between
      two grapevine cultivars of the Pinot family reveals potential genes
      controlling ripening time
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: "Background: Grapevine cultivars of the Pinot family represent
      clonally propagated mutants with major phenotypic and physiological
      differences, such as different colour or shifted ripening time, as well as
      changes in important viticultural traits. Specifically, the cultivars
      'Pinot Noir' (PN) and 'Pinot Noir Precoce' (PNP, early ripening) flower at
      the same time, but vary in the beginning of berry ripening (veraison) and,
      consequently, harvest time. In addition to genotype, seasonal climatic
      conditions (i.e. high temperatures) also affect ripening times. To reveal
      possible regulatory genes that affect the timing of veraison onset, we
      investigated differences in gene expression profiles between PN and PNP
      throughout berry development with a closely meshed time series and over
      two separate years. Results: The difference in the duration of berry
      formation between PN and PNP was quantified to be approximately two weeks
      under the growth conditions applied, using plant material with a proven PN
      and PNP clonal relationship. Clusters of co-expressed genes and
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected which reflect the
      shift in the timing of veraison onset. Functional annotation of these DEGs
      fit to observed phenotypic and physiological changes during berry
      development. In total, we observed 3,342 DEGs in 2014 and 2,745 DEGs in
      2017 between PN and PNP, with 1,923 DEGs across both years. Among these,
      388 DEGs were identified as veraison-specific and 12 were considered as
      berry ripening time regulatory candidates. The expression profiles
      revealed two candidate genes for ripening time control which we designated
      VviRTIC1 and VviRTIC2 (VIT_210s0071g01145 and VIT_200s0366g00020,
      respectively). These genes likely contribute the phenotypic differences
      observed between PN and PNP. Conclusions: Many of the 1,923 DEGs show
      highly similar expression profiles in both cultivars if the patterns are
      aligned according to developmental stage. In our work, putative genes
      differentially expressed between PNP and PN which could control ripening
      time as well as veraison-specific genes were identified. We point out
      connections of these genes to molecular events during berry development
      and discuss potential candidate genes which may control ripening time. Two
      of these candidates were observed to be differentially expressed in the
      early berry development phase. Several down-regulated genes during berry
      ripening are annotated as auxin response factors / ARFs. Conceivably,
      general changes in auxin signaling may cause the earlier ripening
      phenotype of PNP."

    title: Polarized Dishevelled dissolution and condensation drives embryonic axis
      specification in oocytes
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: The organismal body axes that are formed during embryogenesis are
      intimately linked to intrinsic asymmetries established at the cellular
      scale in oocytes. Here, we report an axis-defining event in meiotic
      oocytes of the sea star Patiria miniata. Dishevelled is a cytoplasmic Wnt
      pathway effector required for axis development in diverse species, but the
      mechanisms governing its function and distribution remain poorly defined.
      Using time-lapse imaging, we find that Dishevelled localizes uniformly to
      puncta throughout the cell cortex in Prophase I-arrested oocytes, but
      becomes enriched at the vegetal pole following meiotic resumption through
      a dissolution-condensation mechanism. This process is driven by an initial
      disassembly phase of Dvl puncta, followed by selective reformation of Dvl
      assemblies at the vegetal pole. Rather than being driven by Wnt signaling,
      this localization behavior is coupled to meiotic cell cycle progression
      and influenced by Lamp1+ endosome association and Frizzled receptors
      pre-localized within the oocyte cortex. Our results reveal a cell
      cycle-linked mechanism by which maternal cellular polarity is transduced
      to the embryo through spatially-regulated Dishevelled dynamics.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    raw_message: The flu is interesting.  Either, many COVID cases were counted as
      the flu, or SARS-CoV-2 was the dominant virus this year and thus the flu
      was not able to infect many people.  I suspect we will learn it is a
      combination of both.  Many, many people were declared COVID positive based
      only on symptoms.  My doctor declared I likely had covid and I did not
      even go to the office or take a test.  I had a headache, fever, and a
      cough... Viola!  Covid!!

    abstract: Cells repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through a complex set of
      pathways that are critical for maintaining genomic integrity. Here we
      present Repair-seq, a high-throughput screening approach that measures the
      effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on the distribution of
      mutations introduced at targeted DNA lesions. Using Repair-seq, we
      profiled DSB repair outcomes induced by two programmable nucleases (Cas9
      and Cas12a) after knockdown of 476 genes involved in DSB repair or
      associated processes in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides for
      homology-directed repair (HDR). The resulting data enabled principled,
      data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways and demonstrated
      that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can
      have markedly different genetic dependencies. Systematic interrogation of
      these dependencies then uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB
      repair genes and isolated incompletely characterized repair mechanisms.
      This work provides a foundation for understanding the complex pathways of
      DSB repair and for optimizing genome editing across modalities.

    raw_message: Cite the research.  I can cite dozens of studies that argue the
      opposite.  What you are saying is just not backed by the majority of
      studies.  And real world examples do not bear out what you are
      saying.  Despite nearly 100% masking compliance, countries, states,
      cities, counties with strict mask adherence have not done better than
      their counterparts with no mask mandates and low compliance.  We can see
      real world results after 15 months of masks.  It is really not a debate
      anymore.

    raw_message: That’s not necessarily the case re real vs contrived. The immune
      system may be “keyed” to only the real and original virus, and may not
      recognize significant variants the more different from the original they
      become. The neat thing about mRNA vaccine is that a specific protein was
      strategically chosen as the “key” that, based on many years of research
      and analysis, was believed to be most likely preserved across many future
      mutations. In this way, the mRNA vaccine is very likely to provide better
      immunity to a changing virus.

    raw_message: Good point, and doubly so if they had faith in what President Trump
      was telling the public for months, that having had COVID-19 guaranteed
      immunity. Also there are a lot of people who think they had COVID-19 way
      back in late 2019/early 2020, but never confirmed it with testing and
      probably had some other respiratory illness.

      That's wrong. Please inform yourself better. There are studies confirming
      that natural immunity has the ability to recognize all variants and adapt
      to it, people with natural immunity are just as protected or even more
      that the ones than are vaccinated, with a plus, unvaccinated do not have
      to take serious risks that come after getting this experimental vaccine.
      And by the way the "many years" you refer were done in rats and ferrets,
      not in humans...

    title: Seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate climates
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "While seasonal variation has a known influence on the transmission of
      several respiratory viral infections, its role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      remains unclear. As previous analyses have not accounted for the
      implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the first
      year of the pandemic, they may yield biased estimates of seasonal effects.
      Building on two state-of-the-art observational models and datasets, we
      adapt a fully Bayesian method for estimating the association between
      seasonality and transmission in 143 temperate European regions. We find
      strong seasonal patterns, consistent with a reduction in the time-variable
      Rt of 42.1% (95% CI: 24.7% - 53.4%) from the peak of winter to the peak of
      summer. These results imply that the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2
      transmission is comparable in magnitude to the most effective individual
      NPIs but less than the combined effect of multiple interventions."

      1. While what exact interventions are tracked and what are the results is
      not  not part of this investigation - however, please note the underlying
      studies are in fact "compatible", only estimating different effects. Eg.
      in case of schools, the 1st wave study is estimating the difference
      between "schools open without any precautions in pre-pandemic state" and
      "schools closed". The 2nd wave study is estimating the difference between
      "schools open will all the safety measures implemented in autumn, which
      often included cohorts, improved ventilation, testing, screening for
      symptoms, changes in class layout etc." and "schools closed". If we expect
      the safety measures have some effect, the estimated effect sizes must be
      different, which is indeed the case.


      2. Effect of vaccination was negligible in the study period. The most vaccinated country in the dataset, UK, had about 5% of the population vaccinated mid-Jan (and most UK regions excluded from the study due to VOC)


      3. cos(t) seasonality is a common functional form used for modelling seasonality. Note that e.g. average daily insolation could be well approximated by the first and second term in the Fourier series, leading also to the cos(t) form.

      As mentioned in the preprint, school calendars are included in the school NPI (given the irregularity of school calendars in 2020, I would argue this is the correct choice)

    title: "15 years of introgression studies: quantifying gene flow across
      Eukaryotes"
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: With the rise of affordable next generation sequencing technology,
      introgression - or the exchange of genetic materials between taxa - is
      widely perceived to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although this
      claim is supported by several keystone studies, no thorough assessment on
      the frequency of introgression in nature has been performed to date. In
      this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by providing a
      meta-analysis of the most comprehensive survey of introgression studies in
      Eukaryotes to date (724 papers with claims of introgression). We first
      examined the evidence given to support introgression, and if/how the lines
      of evidence have changed across time. We then collated a single statistic,
      Patterson's D, that quantifies the strength of introgression across 123
      studies to further assess how taxonomic group, divergence time, and
      aspects of life history influence introgression. We find three main
      results. Studies on introgression are much more frequent in plants and
      mammals than any other taxonomic group. The study of introgression has
      shifted from a largely qualitative assessment of whether introgression
      happens, to a focus on when and how much introgression has occurred across
      taxa. The most-often used introgression statistic, Patterson's D, shows
      several intriguing patterns suggesting introgression reports may be biased
      by both differences in reporting criteria and sequencing technology, but
      may also differ across taxonomic systems and throughout the process of
      speciation. Together, these results suggest the need for a unified
      approach to quantifying introgression in natural communities, and
      highlight important areas of future research that can be better assessed
      once this unified approach is met.

      "multiple confounding variables"- such as what ?

      and would this problem of confounding variables also apply to vaccine trials ?



      Thanks

    abstract: Zinc deficiency is linked to poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients while
      clinical trials with Zinc demonstrate better clinical outcome. The
      molecular target and mechanistic details of anti-coronaviral (SARS-CoV2)
      activity of Zinc remain obscure. We show that ionic Zinc not only inhibits
      SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) with nanomolar affinity, but also viral
      replication. We present the first crystal structure of Mpro-Zinc2+ complex
      at 1.9 [A] and provide the structural basis of viral replication
      inhibition.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      I'll answer your first question. Where did you get the idea that people
      who have recovered from Covid don't have immunity? Studies have shown that
      yes, recovered individuals do have immunity to Covid.


      https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420310084


      The point of this study is to show that vaccines should be given to those who have not been infected with Covid since the people who have recovered have developed an immunity to it.

    title: "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of
      parents with young children: a qualitative interview study"
    category: psychiatry-and-clinical-psychology
    abstract: "Background Parents have faced unique challenges during the
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including mobility
      constraints, isolation measures, working from home, and the closure of
      schools and childcare facilities. There is presently a lack of in-depth
      qualitative research exploring how these changes have affected parents
      mental health and wellbeing. Methods Semi-structured qualitative
      interviews with 29 parents of young children. Interviews were analysed
      using reflexive thematic analysis. Results We identified five
      superordinate themes affecting participant mental health and wellbeing: 1)
      navigation of multiple responsibilities and change inside the home; 2)
      disruption to home life; 3) changes to usual support networks; 4) changes
      in personal relationships; and 5) use of coping strategies. Participants
      described stress and exhaustion from navigating multiple pressures and
      conflicting responsibilities with home, schooling, and work, without their
      usual support networks and in the context of disrupted routines. Family
      roles and relationships were sometimes tested, however, many parents
      identified coping strategies that protected their wellbeing including
      access to outdoor space, spending time away from family, and avoiding
      conflict and pandemic-related media coverage. Conclusions Employers must
      be cognisant of the challenges that the pandemic has placed on parents,
      particularly women and lone parents. Flexible working arrangements and
      support might therefore relieve stress and increase productivity. Coping
      strategies identified by parents in this study could be harnessed and
      encouraged by employers and policymakers to promote positive wellbeing
      during times of stress throughout the pandemic and beyond."

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      Wasn't the "VA" study just a review of health records without the all of
      the dosing analysis in this, Smith, et al. study. 


      Some of the main points in Smith, et al are that you have so many obese patients.  Doses of HCQ and AZT need to be weight dependent.  


      "no Covid study has examined the effects of these differences in weight on response to HCQ therapy or HCQ adverse effects."


      Furthermore they noticed that the cumulative dose had a big effect on the outcome.   They explain that HCQ has a long half-life but it also takes a long time to get optimal amounts into the lungs. 


      "We found that when the cumulative doses of two drugs, HCQ and AZM, were above a certain level, patients had a survival rate 2.9 times the other patients...HCQ cumulative dose > 80 mg/kg works substantially better. "


      "Patients receiving >3g HCQ/>1g AZM had 3.26 times lower risk of mortality  than those who did not receive these <b>doses</b> [HR = .307,95% CI = 0.183 – 0.516, p < .001]. Patients receiving TOZ had 2.00 times lower risk of death than patients who did not receive the <b>medicine</b> [HR = .50, 95% CI = 0.36 – 0.69, p < .001]. 


      Their statements about patient EKGs were striking.  They were particularly critical of the FDA's April 2020 warning on the issue. 


      "there was no correlation between HCQ cumulative dose and QTc delta (r = -0.170).... No patient experienced  torsades de pointes...given the data presented here, the studies reporting HCQ’s effect of QTc intervals need to be reevaluated."


      Apparently Smith, et al were looking for ways to make HCQ helpful to Covid patients--a seemingly unusual interest. 


      In contrast Boulware, et al concluded HCQ was not beneficial for post exposure prophylaxis when started within 4 days.   However several other groups reanalyzed the data and concluded HCQ <b>was</b> beneficial when started within 3 days.

    title: Spc1 regulates substrate selection for signal peptidase
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: Signal peptidase (SPase) cleaves the signal sequences (SSs) of
      secretory precursors. It contains an evolutionarily conserved membrane
      protein subunit, Spc1 that is dispensable for the catalytic activity of
      SPase, and its role remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated
      the function of yeast Spc1. First, we set up an in vivo SPase cleavage
      assay using secretory protein CPY variants with SSs modified in the n and
      h regions. When comparing the SS cleavage efficiencies of these variants
      in cells with or without Spc1, we found that signal-anchored sequences
      become more susceptible to cleavage by SPase without Spc1. Further,
      SPase-mediated processing of transmembrane (TM) segments in model membrane
      proteins was reduced upon overexpression of Spc1. Spc1 was
      co-immunoprecipitated with membrane proteins carrying uncleaved
      signal-anchored or TM segments. These results suggest a role of Spc1 in
      shielding TM segments from SPase action, thereby contributing to accurate
      substrate selection for SPase.

    title: Genome-wide study of DNA methylation in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
      identifies differentially methylated loci and implicates metabolic,
      inflammatory and cholesterol pathways
    category: neurology
    abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative
      disease with an estimated heritability of around 50%. DNA methylation
      patterns can serve as biomarkers of (past) exposures and disease
      progression, as well as providing a potential mechanism that mediates
      genetic or environmental risk. Here, we present a blood-based
      epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) meta-analysis in 10,462 samples
      (7,344 ALS patients and 3,118 controls), representing the largest
      case-control study of DNA methylation for any disease to date. We
      identified a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs)
      annotated to 42 genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related
      to metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We show that
      DNA-methylation-based proxies for HDL-cholesterol, BMI, white blood cell
      (WBC) proportions and alcohol intake were independently associated with
      ALS. Integration of these results with our latest GWAS showed that
      cholesterol biosynthesis was causally related to ALS. Finally, we found
      that DNA methylation levels at several DMPs and blood cell proportion
      estimates derived from DNA methylation data, are associated with survival
      rate in patients, and could represent indicators of underlying disease
      processes.

      I am c9 positive and recently had my dna age calculated. To my utter
      disappointment my biological age 63 is higher than my chronological age
      59. 


      In January I did a comprehensive blood test through Boston Heath Diagnostics. My LDL came back higher than normal but other lipids normal, or rather high. HDL was 103, total cholesterol 248. I’ve always been proud of my optimal cholesterol numbers but now I’m thinking egads am I barreling toward symptom onset? Inflammation, Oxidation and Metabolic all optimal. Interestingly my WBC came in low at 3.48. 


      I am a dog walker and walk on average 6 miles daily. I don’t smoke, and drink moderately. I’m living what I consider an ideal healthy lifestyle only to find it will kill me 😩

    title: "RootPainter: Deep Learning Segmentation of Biological Images with
      Corrective Annotation"
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: >-
      We present RootPainter, a GUI-based software tool for the rapid training
      of deep neural networks for use in biological image analysis. RootPainter
      facilitates both fully-automatic and semi-automatic image segmentation. We
      investigate the effectiveness of RootPainter using three plant image
      datasets, evaluating its potential for root length extraction from chicory
      roots in soil, biopore counting and root nodule counting from scanned
      roots. We also use RootPainter to compare dense annotations to corrective
      ones which are added during the training based on the weaknesses of the
      current model.

    abstract: In eukaryotic nuclei, chromatin loops mediated through cohesin are
      critical structures that regulate gene expression and DNA replication.
      Here we demonstrate a new method to visualize endogenous genomic loci
      using synthetic zinc-finger proteins harboring repeat epitope tags (ZF
      probes) for signal amplification via binding of tag-specific intracellular
      antibodies, or frankenbodies, fused with fluorescent proteins. We achieve
      this in two steps. First, we develop an anti-FLAG frankenbody that can
      bind FLAG-tagged proteins in diverse live-cell environments. The anti-FLAG
      frankenbody complements the anti-HA frankenbody, enabling two-color signal
      amplification from FLAG and HA-tagged proteins. Second, we develop a pair
      of cell-permeable ZF probes that specifically bind two endogenous
      chromatin loci predicted to be involved in chromatin looping. By coupling
      our anti-FLAG and anti-HA frankenbodies with FLAG- and HA-tagged ZF
      probes, we simultaneously visualize the dynamics of the two loci in single
      living cells. This reveals close association between the two loci in the
      majority of cells, but the loci markedly separate upon the triggered
      degradation of the cohesin subunit RAD21. Our ability to image two
      endogenous genomic loci simultaneously in single living cells provides a
      proof-of-principle that ZF probes coupled with frankenbodies are useful
      new tools for exploring genome dynamics in multiple colors.

    title: The type 3 secretion system requires actin polymerization to open
      translocon pores
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Many bacterial pathogens require a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) to
      establish a niche. Host contact activates bacterial T3SS assembly of a
      translocon pore in the host plasma membrane. Following pore formation, the
      T3SS docks onto the translocon pore. Docking establishes a continuous
      passage that enables the translocation of virulence proteins, effectors,
      into the host cytosol. Here we investigate the contribution of actin
      polymerization to T3SS-mediated translocation. Using the T3SS model
      organism Shigella flexneri, we show that actin polymerization is required
      for assembling the translocon pore in an open conformation, thereby
      enabling effector translocation. Opening of the pore channel is associated
      with a conformational change to the pore, which is dependent upon actin
      polymerization and a coiled-coil domain in the pore protein IpaC. An IpaC
      mutant is identified that shows actin polymerization-dependent pore
      opening is distinct from the previously described actin
      polymerization-dependent ruffles that are required for bacterial
      internalization. Moreover, actin polymerization is not required for other
      pore functions, including docking or pore protein insertion into the
      plasma membrane. Thus, activation of the T3SS is a multilayered process in
      which host signals are sensed by the translocon pore leading to the
      activation of effector translocation.

      Some comments that may help the authors 



      1) Fig. 2b, what cells are shown in this figure? The legend mentioned MEFs Vim+/+ and Vim-/-, but it is not indicated in the panel,



      2) Fig. 5g. The authors claim that based on the reduced hemoglobin release observed for Q308P (40%) the “pore formed by IpaC Q308P is partially closed” . If the mechanism of RBC lysis is osmotic lysis, a pore large enough to allow water to go through will trigger RBC lysis. The overall hemoglobin release reflect the number of RBC with at least one pore, it would not be directly related to the size of the formed pores as suggested. 



      3) Interaction of IpaC with intermediate filaments (IFs) was tested in solution (yeast cytosol) (Nat. Microb. 2016), where IpaC does not adopt its native membrane-inserted conformation (as in translocon pores). While those experiments suggested a potential interaction between IpaC and IFs, there are not data showing a direct interaction between IpaC and the IFs in functional translocons. While This is very difficult to show, but one should be careful when using this assumption (or model) to interpret new experiments.



      4) The authors claim that "actin polymerization induces conformational changes to the T3SS translocon pore" . However, it is the inhibition of actin polymerization by CytD that affects the proper assembly of the translocon in the target cell membrane. In the absence of CytD, the translocon assembles properly and actin is polymerized.



      5) check lines 251-252 for number of mutants and repeated ones



      6) line 382 was E. coli induced with IPTG?



      7) line 387, what was the ratio RBC/bacteria used during the hemolysis assay?



      8) line 415, did the authors consider the possibility of separating detergent resistant membranes containing translocators in the pellet under this experimental conditions?



      9) line 430, labeling should be insertion



      10) line 436 define F buffer

    title: "Simons Collaborative Marine Atlas Project (Simons CMAP): an open-source
      portal to share, visualize and analyze ocean data"
    category: ecology
    abstract: Simons Collaborative Marine Atlas Project (Simons CMAP) is an
      open-source data portal that interconnects large, complex, and diverse
      public data sets currently dispersed in different formats across different
      Oceanography discipline-specific databases. Simons CMAP is designed to
      streamline the retrieval of custom subsets of data, the generation of data
      visualizations, and the analyses of diverse data, thus expanding the power
      of these potentially underutilized data sets for cross-disciplinary
      studies of ocean processes. We describe a unified architecture that allows
      numerical model outputs, satellite products, and field observations to be
      readily shared, mined, and integrated regardless of data set size or
      resolution. A current focus of Simons CMAP is integration of physical,
      chemical, and biological data sets essential for characterizing the
      biogeography of key marine microbes across ocean basins and seasonal
      cycles. Using a practical example, we demonstrate how our unifying data
      harmonization plans significantly simplifies and allows for systematic
      data integration across all Simons CMAP data sets.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Methodological Approach for Wastewater Based Epidemiological Studies for
      SARS-CoV-2
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Post COVID-19 outbreak, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies as
      surveillance system is becoming an emerging interest due to its functional
      advantage as tool for early warning signal and to catalyze effective
      disease management strategies based on the community diagnosis. A
      comprehensive attempt was made in this study to define a methodological
      approach for conducting WBE studies in the framework of
      identifying/selection of surveillance sites, standardizing sampling
      policy, designing sampling protocols to improve sensitivity, adopting
      safety protocol, and interpreting the data. The methodology was applied to
      a community and studied its epidemiological status with reference to
      occurrence, persistence, and variation of SARS-CoV-2 genome load in
      wastewater system to understand the prevalence of infection. Hourly and
      daily grab samples were analyzed and compared with the composite samples
      over a surveillance window of 7 days. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
      copies/L, faeces shedding, and volume of sewage generated the infected
      individuals and the population who are in active phase in the studied
      community was estimated.

    title: "15 years of introgression studies: quantifying gene flow across
      Eukaryotes"
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: With the rise of affordable next generation sequencing technology,
      introgression - or the exchange of genetic materials between taxa - is
      widely perceived to be a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature. Although this
      claim is supported by several keystone studies, no thorough assessment on
      the frequency of introgression in nature has been performed to date. In
      this manuscript, we aim to address this knowledge gap by providing a
      meta-analysis of the most comprehensive survey of introgression studies in
      Eukaryotes to date (724 papers with claims of introgression). We first
      examined the evidence given to support introgression, and if/how the lines
      of evidence have changed across time. We then collated a single statistic,
      Patterson's D, that quantifies the strength of introgression across 123
      studies to further assess how taxonomic group, divergence time, and
      aspects of life history influence introgression. We find three main
      results. Studies on introgression are much more frequent in plants and
      mammals than any other taxonomic group. The study of introgression has
      shifted from a largely qualitative assessment of whether introgression
      happens, to a focus on when and how much introgression has occurred across
      taxa. The most-often used introgression statistic, Patterson's D, shows
      several intriguing patterns suggesting introgression reports may be biased
      by both differences in reporting criteria and sequencing technology, but
      may also differ across taxonomic systems and throughout the process of
      speciation. Together, these results suggest the need for a unified
      approach to quantifying introgression in natural communities, and
      highlight important areas of future research that can be better assessed
      once this unified approach is met.

    title: Dynamic distortion of the orientation representational space after
      learning in the mouse primary visual cortex
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Learning is an essential cognitive mechanism that supports behavioral
      adaptation through neural processing adjustments. Learning was shown to
      modify sensory integration, yet the nature of those modifications and the
      computational advantages they confer remain unclear. By comparing the
      responses of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons evoked by oriented stimuli
      in naive mice and mice performing an orientation discrimination task, we
      found that the representations of rewarded and non-rewarded cues were
      sparser, more accurate and more stable in trained mice. This improved
      representation was associated with a distortion of the V1 orientation
      space such that stimuli close to the task cues were represented as the
      task stimuli themselves. This distortion was context-dependent, as it was
      absent in trained mice passively viewing the cues. Hence, visual
      processing in V1 was dynamically adapted to enhance the reliability of the
      representation of the learned cues and favor stimulus generalization in
      the task-relevant computational space.

    title: Suboptimal response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in hematologic malignancies
      patients
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Studies describing SARS-CoV-2 immune responses following mRNA
      vaccination in hematology malignancy (HM) patients are virtually
      non-existent. We measured SARS-CoV-2 IgG production in 67 HM patients who
      received 2 mRNA vaccine doses. We found that 46% of HM patients did not
      produce antibodies and were therefore vaccine non-responders. Patients
      with B-cell CLL were at a particularly high risk, as only 23% had
      detectable antibodies despite the fact that nearly 70% of these patients
      were not undergoing cancer therapy. HM patients should be counseled about
      the ongoing risk of COVID-19 despite vaccination. Routine measurement of
      post-vaccine antibodies in HM patients should be considered. Novel
      strategies are needed to prevent COVID-19 in these individuals.

      Hi, I have CLL, asymptomatic and very low count. I had the Pfizer vaccine,
      both doses.  My arm was sore for 3 weeks after the first shot even tho I
      moved it around alot.  On the third day after my second shot, it seemed
      that my shingles was reactivated, big pain, couldn't sleep. My PCP sent me
      to emergency for CT scan. Other than spike in white cell count, nothing
      showed from the scan. I shared the info about this study with PCP and
      Hemotology oncologist to try to get a quantitative antibody test.  I have
      not heard back, other than those tests are extremely difficult to
      get.  Also then with further reading, I learned that even with a
      quantitative test, I would not learn much since there is no standard for
      determining what number is safe.

      My question is:  has there been any new info since this study was posted.  Thanks. J

    abstract: Scientific conferences are biased against women when selecting
      speakers, but recent studies showed a positive trend where the ratio of
      invited female speakers had increased. We have recorded speaking times at
      11 different conferences during 2016-2017 to analyze which factors
      influenced a speaker's time keeping. Men and women went over time 47% and
      41% of the talks, respectively. In a regression analysis, it was found
      that the most important factors that influences how long a presenter spoke
      was 1) their allocated time, 2) their career stage and 3) the level of
      time keeping enforcement. It was also found that gender and the size of
      the conference contributed significantly towards the speaker's timing.
      Male speakers exceeded their allocated time more frequently than female
      speakers, especially at large conferences (60% vs 49%). Since conferences
      are an important arena for science dissemination this might have a
      negative impact on female scientist's careers.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 reprograms both adaptive and
      innate immune responses
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was the first
      registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective
      in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad
      effects of the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have
      combined effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we
      confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced
      effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2
      variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the
      production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon
      stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral,
      fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4
      and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while
      fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA
      BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune
      responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this
      new class of vaccines.

      This is really interesting and needs to be considered further.


      However, such fine tuning effects upon natural infection of artificial eliciting events are - at least from my experience - not unusual, since induced reactions to a specific PAMP always lead to physiological readjustments of "the whole system" and, thus, also affect reactions to certain other immunological stimuli (no upregulations without downregulations).


      Therefore, it's a shame that this preprint is already misused by YouTubers to generate fear of COVID vaccines due to long term effects.

    title: "Honey and Nigella sativa against COVID-19 in Pakistan (HNS-COVID-PK): A
      multi-center placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: No definitive treatment exists for Coronavirus Disease
      2019 (COVID-19). Honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) have established antiviral
      properties. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of HNS against COVID-19.
      METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial at 4 centers in Pakistan. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 adults
      showing moderate or severe disease were enrolled in the study. Patients
      presenting with multi-organ failure, ventilator support, and chronic
      diseases (except diabetes mellitus and hypertension) were excluded.
      Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either honey (1
      gm/Kg/day) and Nigella sativa seeds (80 mg/Kg/day) or placebo up-to 13
      days along with standard care. The outcomes included symptom alleviation,
      viral clearance, and 30-day mortality in the intention-to-treat
      population. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
      NCT04347382. FINDINGS Three hundred and thirteen patients - 210 moderate
      and 103 severe - underwent randomization from April 30 to July 29, 2020.
      Among these, 107 were assigned to HNS whereas 103 to placebo for moderate
      cases. For severe cases, 50 were given HNS, and 53 were given placebos.
      HNS resulted in ~50% reduction in time taken to alleviate symptoms as
      compared to placebo (Moderate (4 versus 7 days), Hazard Ratio [HR]: 6.11;
      95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 4.23-8.84, P<0.0001 and severe (6 versus 13
      days) HR: 4.04; 95% CI, 2.46-6.64, P<0.0001). HNS also cleared the virus 4
      days earlier than the placebo group in moderate (6 versus 10 days, HR:
      5.53; 95% CI: 3.76-8.14, P<0.0001) and severe cases (8.5 versus 12 days,
      HR: 4.32; 95% CI: 2.62-7.13, P<0.0001). HNS further led to a better
      clinical score on day 6 with normal activity resumption in 63.6% versus
      10.9% among moderate cases (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.13, P<0.0001) and
      hospital discharge in 50% versus 2.8% in severe cases (OR: 0.03; 95% CI:
      0.01-0.09, P<0.0001). In severe cases, mortality rate was four-fold lower
      in HNS group than placebo (4% versus 18.87%, OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92,
      P=0.029). No HNS-related adverse effects were observed. INTERPRETATION HNS
      significantly improved symptoms, viral clearance, and mortality in
      COVID-19 patients. Thus, HNS represents an affordable over the counter
      therapy and can either be used alone or in combination with other
      treatments to achieve potentiating effects against COVID-19. FUNDING:

    title: Development of a continuous fluorescence-based assay for N-terminal
      acetyltransferase D
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: N-terminal acetylation catalyzed by N-terminal acetyltransferases
      (NATs) has various biological functions in protein regulation. N-terminal
      acetyltransferase D (NatD) is one of the most specific NAT with only
      histone H4 and H2A proteins as the known substrates. Dysregulation of NatD
      has been implicated in colorectal and lung cancer progression, implying
      its therapeutic potential in cancers. However, there is no reported
      inhibitor for NatD yet. To facilitate the discovery of small-molecule NatD
      inhibitors, we report the development of a fluorescence-based
      acetyltransferase assay in 384-well high-throughput screening (HTS) format
      through monitoring the formation of coenzyme A. The fluorescent signal is
      generated from the adduct in the reaction between coenzyme A and
      fluorescent probe ThioGlo4. The assay exhibited a Z-factor of 0.77 and a
      coefficient of variation of 6%, indicating it is a robust assay for HTS. A
      pilot screen of 1280 pharmacologically active compounds and subsequent
      validation identified two hits, confirming the application of this
      fluorescence assay in HTS.

    title: Novel bisubstrate inhibitors for protein N-terminal acetyltransferase D
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: Protein N-terminal acetyltransferase D (NatD, NAA40) that specifically
      acetylates the alpha-N-terminus of histone H4 and H2A has been implicated
      in various diseases, but no inhibitor has been reported for this important
      enzyme. Based on the acetyl transfer mechanism of NatD, we designed and
      prepared a series of highly potent NatD bisubstrate inhibitors by
      covalently linking coenzyme A to different peptide substrates via an
      acetyl or propionyl spacer. The most potent bisubstrate inhibitor
      displayed an apparent Ki value of 1.0 nM. Biochemical studies indicated
      that bisubstrate inhibitor is competitive to the peptide substrate and
      noncompetitive to the cofactor, suggesting NatD undergoes an ordered Bi-Bi
      mechanism. We also demonstrated that these inhibitors are highly specific
      towards NatD, displaying about 1,000-fold selectivity over other closely
      related acetyltransferases. High-resolution crystal structures of NatD
      bound to two of these inhibitors revealed the molecular basis for their
      selectivity and inhibition mechanism, providing a rational path for future
      inhibitor development.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: "Reopening Italy's Schools in September 2020: A Bayesian Estimation of
      the Change in the Growth Rate of New SARS-CoV-2 Cases"
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: CoViD-19's second wave started a debate on the
      potential role of schools as a primary factor in the contagion resurgence.
      Two opposite positions appeared: those convinced that schools played a
      major role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 infections and those who were not. We
      studied the growth rate of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in
      all the Italian regions, before and after the school reopening (September
      - October 2020), investigating the hypothesis of an association between
      schools and the resurgence of the virus in Italy. Methods: Using Bayesian
      piecewise linear regression to scrutinize the number of daily SARS-CoV-2
      infections in each Italian, we looked for an estimate of a changepoint in
      the growth rate of those confirmed cases. We compared the changepoints
      with the school opening dates, for each Italian region. The regression
      allows to discuss the change in steepness of the infection curve, before
      and after the changepoint. Results: In 15 out of 21 Italian regions (71%),
      an estimated change in the rate of growth of the total number of daily
      SARS-CoV-2 infection cases occurred after an average of 16.66 days (CI 95%
      14.47 to 18.73) since the school reopening. The number of days required
      for the SARS-CoV-2 daily cases to double went from an average of 47.50
      days (CI 95% 37.18 to 57.61) before the changepoint to an average of 7.72
      days (CI 95% 7.00 to 8.48) after it. Conclusion: Studying the rate of
      growth of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in all the Italian regions provides some
      evidence in favor of a link between school reopening and the resurgence of
      the virus in Italy. The number of factors that could have played a role
      are too many to give a definitive answer. Still, the temporal
      correspondence warrants for a controlled experiment to clarify how much
      reopening schools mattered."

      We thank Maurizio for the careful reading of our paper and his interesting
      comment.


      We do agree that elections and workers are two factors of a certain relevance that, besides school reopenings, deserve attention and further investigations. We have already maintained this in our paper (abstract, limitations, discussion, conclusion).


      Nonetheless, Maurizio should give more credit to the following facts:

      - elections were held on two different days (sun 20 and mon 21), hence the number of participants should be distributed over two different days

      - Italian students and school personell (11 million people on a national basis) go to school each and every day (mon-fri/sat)

      - Mobility reports by Google tag workplaces (Google News. https://news.google.com/covid19/map?hl=it&gl=IT&ceid=IT%3Ait&mid=%2Fm%2F03rjj)

      The revised version of our paper, which is going to appear on a renowned International medical journal, discusses all those points above.


      Sincerely,

      The Authors

    abstract: The Spike protein (S protein) is a critical component in the infection
      of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The objective of this work was to
      evaluate whether peptides from S protein could cause negative impact in
      the aquatic animals. The aquatic toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
      peptides derivatives has been evaluated in tadpoles (n = 50 tadpoles / 5
      replicates of 10 animals) from species Physalaemus cuvieri
      (Leptodactylidae). After synthesis, purification, and characterization of
      peptides (PSDP2001, PSDP2002, PSDP2003) an aquatic contamination has been
      simulatedwith these peptides during 24 hours of exposure in two
      concentrations (100 and 500 ng/mL). The control group (C) was composed of
      tadpoles kept in polyethylene containers containing de-chlorinated water.
      Oxidative stress, antioxidant biomarkers and neurotoxicity activity were
      assessed. In both concentrations, PSPD2002 and PSPD2003 increased catalase
      and superoxide dismutase antioxidants enzymes activities, as well as
      oxidative stress (nitrite levels, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen
      species). All three peptides also increased acetylcholinesterase activity
      in the highest concentration. These peptides showed molecular interactions
      in silico with acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes. Aquatic
      particle contamination of SARS-CoV-2 has neurotoxics effects in P. cuvieri
      tadpoles. These findings indicate that the COVID-19 can constitute
      environmental impact or biological damage potential.

    title: "Global Economic Cost of Deaths Attributable to Ambient Air Pollution:
      Disproportionate Burden on the Ageing Population"
    category: health-economics
    abstract: "Summary Background The health impacts of ambient air pollution impose
      large costs on society. While all people are exposed to air pollution,
      older individuals tend to be disproportionally affected. As a result,
      there is growing concern about the public health impacts of air pollution
      as many countries undergo rapid population ageing. We investigated the
      spatial and temporal variation in the health economic cost of deaths
      attributable to ambient air pollution, and its interaction with population
      ageing from 2000 to 2016 at global and regional levels. Methods We
      developed an age-adjusted measure of the value of a statistical life year
      (VSLY) to estimate the health economic cost attributable to ambient PM2.5
      pollution using the Global Burden of Disease 2017 data and country-level
      socioeconomic information. First, we estimated the global age- and
      cause-specific mortality and years of life lost (YLL) attributable to
      PM2.5 pollution using the global exposure mortality model (GEMM) and
      global estimates of exposure derived from ground monitoring, satellite
      retrievals and chemical transport model simulations at 0.1 by 0.1 degree
      (~11 km at the equator) resolution. Second, for each year between 2000 and
      2016, we translated the YLL within each age-group into a health-related
      economic cost using a country-specific, age-adjusted measure of VSLY.
      Third, we decomposed the major driving factors that contributed to the
      temporal change in health costs related to PM2.5. Finally, we conducted a
      sensitivity test to analyze the variability of the estimated health costs
      to four alternative valuation measures. We identified the uncertainty
      intervals (UIs) from 1000 draws of the parameters and exposure-response
      functions by age, cause, country and year. All economic values are
      reported in 2011 purchasing-power-parity-adjusted US dollars. Findings
      Globally, 8.42 million (95% UI: 6.50, 10.52) deaths and 163.68 million
      (116.03, 219.44) YLL were attributable to ambient PM2.5 in 2016. The
      average attributable mortality for the older population was 12 times
      higher than for those younger than 60 years old. In 2016, the global
      health economic cost of ambient PM2.5 pollution for the older population
      was US$2.40 trillion (1.89, 2.93) accounting for 59% of the cost for the
      total population. The health cost for the older population alone was
      equivalent to 2.1% (1.7%, 2.6%) of global gross domestic product (GDP) in
      2016. While the economic cost per capita for the older population was
      US$2739 (2160, 3345) in 2016, the cost per capita for the younger
      population was only US$268 (205, 335). From 2000 to 2016, the annual
      global health economic cost for the total population increased from
      US$2.37 trillion (1.88, 2.87) to US$4.09 trillion (3.19, 5.05).
      Decomposing the factors that contributed to the rise in health economic
      costs, we found that increases in GDP per capita, population ageing,
      population growth, age-specific mortality reduction, and PM2.5 exposure
      changed the total health economic cost by 77%, 21.2%, 15.6%, -41.1% and
      -0.2%, respectively. Compared to using an age-invariant VSLY or an
      age-invariant value of a statistical life (VSL), the estimates of the
      older population share of the total health economic cost using an
      age-adjusted VSLY was 2 and 18 percentage points lower, respectively.
      Interpretation The health economic cost borne by the older population
      almost doubled between 2000 and 2016, driven primarily by GDP growth,
      population ageing and population growth. Compared to younger individuals,
      air pollution leads to disproportionately higher health costs amongst the
      older population, even after accounting for their relatively shorter
      remaining life expectancy and increased disability. The age-specific
      estimates of health economic cost inform the optimal design of air
      pollution reduction strategies and allocation of healthcare resources. The
      positive relationship between age and economic costs suggests that
      countries with severe air pollution and rapid aging rates would
      particularly benefit from improving their air quality. In addition,
      strategies aimed at enhancing healthcare services, especially for the
      older population, may be beneficial for reducing the costs of ambient air
      pollution."

    title: Glucocorticoids and B Cell Depleting Agents Substantially Impair
      Immunogenicity of mRNA Vaccines to SARS-CoV-2
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: >-
      BackgroundIndividuals with chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) are
      frequently treated with immunosuppressive medications that can increase
      their risk of severe COVID-19. While novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2
      vaccination platforms provide robust protection in immunocompetent
      individuals, the immunogenicity in CID patients on immunosuppression is
      not well established. Therefore, determining the effectiveness of
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the setting of immunosuppression is essential to
      risk-stratify CID patients with impaired protection and provide clinical
      guidance regarding medication management.


      MethodsWe conducted a prospective assessment of mRNA-based vaccine immunogenicity in 133 adults with CIDs and 53 immunocompetent controls. Blood from participants over 18 years of age was collected before initial immunization and 1-2 weeks after the second immunization. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG+ binding, neutralizing antibody titers, and circulating S-specific plasmablasts were quantified to assess the magnitude and quality of the humoral response following vaccination.


      ResultsCompared to immunocompetent controls, a three-fold reduction in anti-S IgG titers (P=0.009) and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (p<0.0001) were observed in CID patients. B cell depletion and glucocorticoids exerted the strongest effect with a 36- and 10-fold reduction in humoral responses, respectively (p<0.0001). Janus kinase inhibitors and antimetabolites, including methotrexate, also blunted antibody titers in multivariate regression analysis (P<0.0001, P=0.0023, respectively). Other targeted therapies, such as TNF inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and integrin inhibitors, had only modest impacts on antibody formation and neutralization.


      ConclusionsCID patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies exhibit impaired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immunity, with glucocorticoids and B cell depletion therapy more severely impeding optimal responses.

      What are the doses or the duration of the treatment with glucocorticoids
       of this study? I'm in a middle of a prednisona treatment I will get the
       Pfizer vaccine in a few days. I have a cycle of 50mg x3days, 30mg 
      x3days, 15mgx3 days and 5mg x2months and I want to know if it's better 
      now (15mg) or next week with 5mg but more time with the treatment.

      detection kits can give false-positive results for both viruses in regions
      where both COVID-19 and Dengue co-exist
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Five of thirteen Dengue antibody- positive serum samples, dated 2017
      (pre-dating the COVID-19 outbreak) produced false-positive results in
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM rapid strip tests. Our results emphasize the importance
      of NAT and/or virus antigen tests to complement sero-surveillance for
      definitive diagnosis of COVID-19/Dengue in regions where both viruses are
      co-endemic.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    raw_message: There are two other large post-exposure prophylaxis trials which
      showed no benefit of HCQ (Mitja NEJM; Barnabas CID).   The post-hoc
      analyses of the Boulware NEJM seems a likely over interpretation of small
      subgroups -- which are not able to be replicated in the other
      trials.  This is common in post-hoc analyses.   In large datasets, one can
      find a subgroup who do better, but is it true?  If true, one should be
      able to replicate in other trials.

    title: "Antibody response after a single dose of ChAdOx1-nCOV (Covishield)
      vaccine in subjects with prior SARS-CoV2 infection: Is a single dose
      sufficient?"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "It is crucial to know whether a single dose of vaccine against
      SARS-CoV-2 is sufficient to elicit immune response in previously infected
      people in India. A total of 121 participants (baseline seropositive 46 and
      seronegative 75) were included to study the immune response to
      ChAdOx1-nCOV (Covishield) vaccine in previously infected or uninfected
      people. IgG antibodies were estimated at three different time intervals,
      i.e. pre-vaccination, 25-35 days post 1st vaccination and 25-35 days post
      2nd vaccination. The IgG antibody titre was significantly high among
      previous seropositive subjects with single dose of vaccine compared to
      seronegative group with both doses of vaccine respectively
      (Mean:4.59,SD:1.04 vs Mean:3.08 SD:1.22, p-value: <0.0001). In conclusion,
      a single dose of Covishield vaccine might be sufficient to induce an
      effective immune response n subjects with prior SARS-CoV2 infection.
      Stratifying vacinees based on their SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody titre before
      vaccination would help in meeting the increasing vaccine demand and could
      be effective to circumvent further wave of the pandemic in India."

      What the figures show is not well explained in the abstract or the text
      itself. Basically they show that people who were previously infected had a
      level of antibodies at baseline (prior to vaccination) which is roughly
      equal to those not previously infected after two doses. After one dose,
      they exceed that level.



      Furthermore it also shows that most of the persons not previously infected don't benefit from a second dose, since the average is roughly the same after one and two doses. Only a small subset of the subjects seem to get some benefit from a second dose.



      Therefor, it seems a more logical conclusion that persons previously infected should not need to take the vaccine and that people previously infected should take just one dose (with a few exceptions).



      Always remember that in medicine, when you need to take something you should take it. But when you don't need to take it, you shouldn't take it.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      hi -  i think there is a typo!  This says 8/174 -- yet earlier it said
      175.


      The overall prevalence of persistent symptoms was 1.7% (80/4678 children; 95% CI 1.4%, 2.1%), and 4.6% (8/174 children; 95% CI 2.0%, 8.9%) in children who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection before persistent symptom onset.


      Also ages 2-11 were overrepresented versus 12-17

    abstract: Microscopic bioluminescence imaging has been historically challenging
      due to a lack of detection methods and easily resolved probes. Here we
      combine bioluminescence with phasor analysis, an optical method commonly
      used to distinguish spectrally similar fluorophores. Bioluminescent phasor
      enabled rapid differentiation of multiple luciferase reporters and
      resonance energy transfer processes. The merger of bioluminescence and
      phasor analysis provides a platform for routine, time-lapse imaging of
      collections of cellular features.

    title: Seasonal variation in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in temperate climates
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "While seasonal variation has a known influence on the transmission of
      several respiratory viral infections, its role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission
      remains unclear. As previous analyses have not accounted for the
      implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the first
      year of the pandemic, they may yield biased estimates of seasonal effects.
      Building on two state-of-the-art observational models and datasets, we
      adapt a fully Bayesian method for estimating the association between
      seasonality and transmission in 143 temperate European regions. We find
      strong seasonal patterns, consistent with a reduction in the time-variable
      Rt of 42.1% (95% CI: 24.7% - 53.4%) from the peak of winter to the peak of
      summer. These results imply that the seasonality of SARS-CoV-2
      transmission is comparable in magnitude to the most effective individual
      NPIs but less than the combined effect of multiple interventions."

      ad 1, I am not sure how compatible the studies are. I understand Your
      explanation of the differencies, still they can work as underlying set
      only if done with exact same interventions, same countries etc

      ad 2 My mistake, did not realise the early end of the second study, it just shows how pure data are on the whole year, taking into account the gradual spread and chaotic treatment of the first year and the variants evolved later

      ad 3 Sure, if You do not have any other idea and no supporting data how to incorporate a would be periodic behaviour, cos(t) may be the first choice. However, with the multicountry studies You indeed have a reasonable data not only on seasonality, but also on the differences between each of them.  You can use the daily temperatures and percentage of local sunshine hours. It is just a pitty not to use them and not to see the fundamental driving force.

    title: "Inhaled budesonide for COVID-19 in people at higher risk of adverse
      outcomes in the community: interim analyses from the PRINCIPLE trial"
    category: primary-care-research
    abstract: BACKGROUND Inhaled budesonide has shown efficacy for treating COVID-19
      in the community but has not yet been tested in effectiveness trials.
      METHODS We performed a multicenter, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive
      platform randomized controlled trial involving people aged [&ge;]65 years,
      or [&ge;]50 years with comorbidities, and unwell [&le;]14 days with
      suspected COVID-19 in the community (PRINCIPLE). Participants were
      randomized to usual care, usual care plus inhaled budesonide (800g twice
      daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions. The co-primary
      endpoints are time to first self-reported recovery, and
      hospitalization/death related to COVID-19, both measured over 28 days from
      randomisation and analysed using Bayesian models. RESULTS The trial opened
      on April 2, 2020. Randomization to inhaled budesonide began on November
      27, 2020 and was stopped on March 31, 2021 based on an interim analysis
      using data from March 4, 2021. Here, we report updated interim analysis
      data from March 25, 2021, at which point the trial had randomized 4663
      participants with suspected COVID-19. Of these, 2617 (56.1%) tested
      SARS-CoV-2 positive and contributed data to this interim budesonide
      primary analysis; 751 budesonide, 1028 usual care and 643 to other
      interventions. Time to first self-reported recovery was shorter in the
      budesonide group compared to usual care (hazard ratio 1.208 [95% BCI 1.076
      - 1.356], probability of superiority 0.999, estimated benefit [95% BCI] of
      3.011 [1.134 - 5.41] days). Among those in the interim budesonide primary
      analysis who had the opportunity to contribute data for 28 days follow up,
      there were 59/692 (8.5%) COVID-19 related hospitalizations/deaths in the
      budesonide group vs 100/968 (10.3%) in the usual care group (estimated
      percentage benefit, 2.1% [95% BCI -0.7% - 4.8%], probability of
      superiority 0.928). CONCLUSIONS In this updated interim analysis, inhaled
      budesonide reduced time to recovery by a median of 3 days in people with
      COVID-19 with risk factors for adverse outcomes. Once 28 day follow up is
      complete for all participants randomized to budesonide, final analyses of
      time to recovery and hospitalization/death will be published. (Funded by

    title: Evidence for increased breakthrough rates of SARS-CoV-2 variants of
      concern in BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinated individuals
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been raging for over a year, creating
      global detrimental impact. The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated high
      protection levels, yet apprehension exists that several variants of
      concerns (VOCs) can surmount the immune defenses generated by the
      vaccines. Neutralization assays have revealed some reduction in
      neutralization of VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the relevance of these
      assays in real life remains unclear. Here, we performed a case-control
      study that examined whether BNT162b2 vaccinees with documented SARS-CoV-2
      infection were more likely to become infected with B.1.1.7 or B.1.351
      compared with unvaccinated individuals. Vaccinees infected at least a week
      after the second dose were disproportionally infected with B.1.351 (odds
      ratio of 8:1). Those infected between two weeks after the first dose and
      one week after the second dose, were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7
      (odds ratio of 26:10), suggesting reduced vaccine effectiveness against
      both VOCs under different dosage/timing conditions. Nevertheless, the
      B.1.351 incidence in Israel to-date remains low and vaccine effectiveness
      remains high against B.1.1.7, among those fully vaccinated. These results
      overall suggest that vaccine breakthrough infection is more frequent with
      both VOCs, yet a combination of mass-vaccination with two doses coupled
      with non-pharmaceutical interventions control and contain their spread.

    title: Cortical depth-dependent human fMRI of resting-state networks using EPIK
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Recent laminar-fMRI studies have provided substantial understanding of
      the evoked cortical responses in multiple sub-systems; in contrast, the
      laminar component of resting-state networks spread over the whole brain
      remains largely unknown. Here, we used EPIK, which offers unprecedented
      coverage at sub-millimetre resolution, to investigate cortical broad
      resting-state dynamics with depth specificity. After verifying laminar
      activation profiles in response to a motor task, we observed that the
      amplitude of the resting state fluctuations was larger in the superficial
      layers of the cortical ribbon, and that these superficial layers had a
      stronger local functional connectivity (regional homogeneity) in sulci but
      not in gyri. Cortical-depth dependent correlation and coherence analysis
      revealed that resting-state connections involved mostly the supragranular
      layers of the cortex, although the preferred laminae through which
      networks communicated was variable. Using a second resting-state scan as
      control data and comparing the results obtained during task performance
      with the resting-state condition, we identified a modified distribution of
      layer-specific responses that seemed dependent on brain state, both in the
      ROIs presumably involved in the motor task, and in those supporting
      resting-state networks. Whole-brain evaluation of laminar-fMRI encompasses
      unprecedented computational challenges; nonetheless, it enables a new
      dimension of the human cerebral cortex to be investigated from a global
      view, which may be key in the characterization of neurological disorders
      from a novel perspective.

    title: Extensive protein dosage compensation in aneuploid human cancers
    category: genomics
    abstract: Aneuploidy is a hallmark of human cancers, but the effects of
      aneuploidy on protein expression remain poorly understood. To uncover how
      chromosome copy number changes influence the cancer proteome, we have
      conducted an analysis of hundreds of human cancer cell lines with matched
      copy number, RNA expression, and protein expression data. We found that a
      majority of proteins exhibit dosage compensation and fail to change by the
      degree expected based on chromosome copy number alone. We uncovered a
      variety of gene groups that were recurrently buffered upon both chromosome
      gain and loss, including protein complex subunits and cell cycle genes.
      Several genetic and biophysical factors were predictive of protein
      buffering, highlighting complex post-translational regulatory mechanisms
      that maintain appropriate gene product dosage. Finally, we established
      that chromosomal aneuploidy has an unexpectedly moderate effect on the
      expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, demonstrating that these
      key cancer drivers can be subject to dosage compensation as well. In
      total, our comprehensive analysis of aneuploidy and dosage compensation
      across cancers will help identify the key driver genes encoded on altered
      chromosomes and will shed light on the overall consequences of aneuploidy
      during tumor development.

    title: A Novel and Expanding SARS-CoV-2 Variant, B.1.526, Identified in New York
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Recent months have seen surges of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the
      globe along with considerable viral evolution1-3. Extensive mutations in
      the spike protein may threaten efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic
      monoclonal antibodies4. Two signature mutations of concern are E484K,
      which plays a crucial role in the loss of neutralizing activity of
      antibodies, and N501Y, a driver of rapid worldwide transmission of the
      B.1.1.7 lineage. Here, we report the emergence of a novel variant lineage
      B.1.526 that contains E484K and its alarming rise to dominance in New York
      City in recent months. This variant is partially or completely resistant
      to two therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in clinical use. It is also less
      susceptible to neutralization by convalescent plasma or vaccinee sera by
      4.1-fold or 3.3-3.6-fold, respectively. The B.1.526 lineage has now been
      reported from at least 32 states in the US and numerous other countries.
      B.1526 has been outpacing B.1.1.7 in Northern Manhattan, and both variants
      have been spreading throughout New York with comparable estimated doubling
      times. Such transmission dynamics, together with its resistance to
      therapeutic antibodies, would warrant B.1.526 as a SARS-CoV-2 variant of
      concern.

      Just one question about this statement in your"Materials&Methods":
      .."between November 1, 2020 and March 5, 2020.." : I assume you mean March
      2021? 

      It would make a difference, if the statement as currently written (March 2020)

      is indeed correct.

      Thank you for your interest! In Supplementary Data 2, there is a list of
      genes with their expression difference upon chromosome gain and loss, as
      well as the classification as either "Scaling", "Buffered", or
      "Anti-Scaling". 


      Not all genes are included in the analysis, as I only took genes with a minimum of 10 datapoints per gain/neutral/loss chromosome category. Hopefully, your proteins of interest are in the list. 


      This data should already be available (link: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2021/06/18/2021.06.18.449005/DC6/embed/media-6.xlsx?download=true), if you have any trouble accessing it, please get in contact with us, and we will send it to you directly.

      Male pregnancy is a unique phenomenon in syngnathidae which refers to the
      incubation of embryos or fetuses by males. However, whether male mammalian
      animals have the potential to conceive and maintain pregnancy remains
      unclear. Here, we constructed a rat model of male pregnancy by a four-step
      strategy: a heterosexual parabiotic pair was firstly produced by
      surgically joining a castrated male rat and a female rat. Uterus
      transplantation (UTx) was then performed on the male parabiont 8 weeks
      later. After recovery, blastocyst-stage embryos were transplanted to the
      grafted uterus of male parabiont and the native uterus of female
      parabiont. Caesarean section was performed at embryonic day (ED) 21.5. The
      success rate of modeling was only 3.68%, but 10 pups could still be
      delivered from male parabionts and developed. Our experiment reveals the
      possibility of normal embryonic development in male mammalian animals, and
      it may have a profound impact on reproductive biology.


      One-sentence summaryA rat model of male pregnancy can be constructed in four steps.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      It's confusing and uncertain.


      <b>All </b>of the studies show that antibody levels decline somewhat over time, so there's some concern that immunity <b>might </b>eventually wear off, as it does with some diseases. But the studies have only lasted for 4-6 months, so it's too soon to tell. It does look like the doctor's advice that "you definitely don't need a vaccine until at least 6 months" is sound. It'll <b>probably </b>turn out that immunity lasts longer, maybe even for life, but we don't know yet. 


      A word about "immunity": vaccines or survival don't mean that you won't get infected (again). What they do is "educate" your immune system so it <b>immediately </b>springs into action, instead of waiting to recognize that "Hey! This thing is hurting me!". Notice that nearly all the cases reported in the vaccine trials are asymptomatic, only a small number are "mild", and <b>none </b>have been severe or fatal.


      To allay your concerns, the fact that your parents were only recently infected means that there are <b>tens of millions</b> of people who are <b>way </b>ahead of them on whatever curve there might be. So, if it does turn out that resistance declines too much, they'll get lots of warning.

    title: Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank
    category: neurology
    abstract: There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19,
      some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast
      majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative,
      gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on
      hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of
      COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated
      manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of
      the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021
      hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit.
      Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal
      data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study,
      with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection
      between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans
      from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes
      between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for
      age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant
      effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left
      parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left
      insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results
      extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and
      temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been
      hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were
      not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19
      vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey
      matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and
      hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|>3). Our findings thus consistently
      relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to
      the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease
      studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the
      danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being
      mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the
      virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and
      the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo
      hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory
      and gustatory pathways.

    title: Favorable outcome on viral load and culture viability using Ivermectin in
      early treatment of non-hospitalized patients with mild COVID-19, A
      double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial.
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent, also has antiviral
      properties. Our aim was to assess whether ivermectin can shorten the viral
      shedding in patients at an early stage of COVID19 infection. Methods: The
      double blinded trial compared patients receiving ivermectin 0.2 mg/kg for
      3 days vs. placebo in non-hospitalized COVID19 patients. RT-PCR from a
      nasopharyngeal swab was obtained at recruitment and then every two days.
      Primary endpoint was reduction of viral-load on the 6th day (third day
      after termination of treatment) as reflected by Ct level>30
      (non-infectious level). The primary outcome was supported by determination
      of viral culture viability. Results: Eighty nine patients were eligible
      (47 in ivermectin and 42 in placebo arm). Their median age was 35 years.
      Females accounted for 21.6%, and 16.8% were asymptomatic at recruitment.
      Median time from symptom onset was 4 days. There were no statistical
      differences in these parameters between the two groups. On day 6, 34 out
      of 47 (72%) patients in the ivermectin arm reached the endpoint, compared
      to 21/ 42 (50%) in the placebo arm (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.09 to 6.31). In a
      multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of a negative test at
      day 6 was 2.62 time higher in the ivermectin group (95% CI: 1.06 to 6.45).
      Cultures at days 2 to 6 were positive in 3/23 (13.0%) of ivermectin
      samples vs. 14/29 (48.2%) in the placebo group (p=0.008). Conclusions:
      There were significantly lower viral loads and viable cultures in the
      ivermectin group, which could lead to shortening isolation time in these
      patients."

    raw_message: Has anyone given consideration to the fact that Ivermectin is

      it be that the ivermectin used in this study killed some kind of parasite
      common to most humans, thereby relieving the natural defense system from
      that fight and allowing it to attack the virus full force.  Being already
      exercised by the battle of the parasites, the defense system would be
      strong.  Suddenly relieving it of that battle could be like when you go in
      your car, but it seems to require that you give it a lot of extra
      gas.  You realize the parking brake is on and release it.  So the car
      suddenly takes off, throwing you back in the seat.

    title: Identification of ultra-rare genetic variants in Pediatric Acute Onset
      Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) by exome and whole genome sequencing
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: "Pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) is viewed as
      an autoimmune/autoinflammatory condition characterized by the abrupt onset
      of severe neurological and psychiatric symptoms, in particular
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, anxiety, mood swings,
      irritability, and restricted eating, often triggered by infections.
      However, direct evidence of autoimmunity, infections, or a proinflammatory
      state is often lacking, and there is no unifying pathogenic pathway. This
      could be due to underlying genetic heterogeneity, which could lead to the
      development of PANS through different cellular and molecular pathways.
      Unfortunately, little is known about the genetic basis of PANS.
      Consequently, we carried out whole exome sequencing (WES) on a U.S. cohort
      of 386 cases who met diagnostic criteria for PANS, including 133 family
      triads, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) on ten cases from the European
      Union, who were selected for WGS because of severe PANS symptoms. We
      focused on identifying potentially deleterious genetic variants that were
      either de novo or ultra-rare with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.001.
      Candidate mutations were found in 11 genes: PPM1D, SGCE, PLCG2, NLRC4,
      CACNA1B, SHANK3, CHK2, GRIN2A, RAG1, GABRG2, and SYNGAP1 in a total of 20
      cases, which included two sets of siblings, and two or more unrelated
      subjects with ultra-rare variants in SGCE, NLRC4, RAG1, and SHANK3. The
      PANS candidate genes we identified separate into two broad functional
      categories. One group regulates peripheral innate and adaptive immune
      responses (e.g., PPM1D, CHK2, NLRC4, RAG1, PLCG2), some of which also
      influence microglia function. Another is expressed primarily at neuronal
      synapses or directly modulates synaptic function (SHANK3, SYNGAP1, GRIN2A,
      GABRG2, CACNA1B, SGCE). These neuronal PANS candidate genes are often
      mutated in autism spectrum disorder, developmental disorders, and
      myoclonus-dystonia. In fact, eight out of 20 cases in this study developed
      PANS superimposed on a preexisting neurodevelopmental disorder. There is,
      however, clinical overlap between these two groups and some crossover
      expression (e.g., some neuronal genes are expressed in immune cells and
      vice versa) that diminishes the neuronal/immune dichotomy. Genes in both
      categories are also highly expressed in the enteric nervous system, and in
      the choroid plexus and brain vasculature, suggesting they might contribute
      to a breach in the blood-CSF barrier and blood-brain barrier (BBB) that
      would permit the entry of autoantibodies, inflammatory cytokines,
      chemokines, prostaglandins, and autoantibodies into the brain. Thus, PANS
      is a genetically heterogeneous condition that can occur as a stand-alone
      neuropsychiatric condition or co-morbid with neurodevelopmental disorders,
      with candidate genes functioning at several levels of the
      neuroinflammatory axis."

      Thank you for this paper - parents of PANS patients are grateful to see
      this kind of genetics work being done on PANS.  May I ask:


      1) What was the total number of variants meeting the criteria described (at lines 141-144 of the document for the European samples, and lines 154-158 for the U.S samples)?


      2) Presumably, the list of candidate genes (described at lines 161-162) were all the genes that encompassed the variant lists in 1) above, with the possible exception of MTHC2 and BID that are mentioned as additions.  What was the total number of  candidate genes considered, before the list was narrowed to the 11 listed?

    title: Artemisinin-based hybrids produce intracellular proteasome inhibitors
      that overcome resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Artemisinin resistant Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is spreading despite
      combination chemotherapy (ACT). Here we report the design of artezomibs,
      single-molecule hybrids of an artemisinin and a Pf-selective proteasome
      inhibitor. Artezomibs exert a novel mode of action inside the malaria
      parasites. The artemisinin component covalently modifies parasite
      proteins, which become substrates of the Pf proteasome. The proteasomal
      degradation products that bear the proteasome inhibitor component of the
      hybrid then inhibit Pf proteasomes, including those with mutations that
      reduce binding affinity of the proteasome inhibitor component on its own.
      We demonstrated that artezomibs circumvent both artemisinin resistance
      conferred by Kelch13 polymorphism and resistance to the proteasome
      inhibitor associated with mutations in Pf proteasomes. This mode of action
      may enable the use of a single molecule with one pharmacokinetic profile
      to prevent the emergence of resistance.

    title: Combining chemogenomic and gene-dose assays to investigate drug synergy
    category: genomics
    abstract: From the earliest days of using natural remedies to modern
      applications of clinically tested medications, combining therapies for
      disease treatment has been standard practice. Combination treatments can
      exhibit synergistic effects, broadly defined as a greater-than-additive
      effect of two or more therapeutic agents. Indeed, clinicians often use
      their experience and expertise to tailor such combinations in the hopes of
      maximizing the therapeutic effect. Alongside these efforts, computational
      studies into understanding and predicting the biophysical underpinnings of
      how synergy is achieved have benefitted from high-throughput screening and
      computational biology. One challenge is how to best design and analyze the
      results of synergy studies performed at scale, especially because the
      number of possible combinations to test quickly becomes unmanageable, and
      the tools to analyze the resulting data are quite new. Nevertheless, the
      benefits of such studies are clear -- by combining multiple drugs in the
      treatment of infectious disease and cancer, for instance, one can lessen
      host toxicity and simultaneously reduce the likelihood of resistance to
      treatment. In this study, we extend the widely validated chemogenomic
      HIPHOP assay to drug combinations. We identify a class of
      ''combination-specific sensitive strains'' that suggest mechanisms for the
      synergies we observe and further suggest focused follow-up studies.

    title: Emergent RNA-RNA interactions can promote stability in a nascent
      phototrophic endosymbiosis
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: "Eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis was responsible for the spread of
      chloroplast (plastid) organelles. Stability is required for the metabolic
      and genetic integration that drives the establishment of new organelles,
      yet the mechanisms which act to stabilise nascent endosymbioses - between
      two fundamentally selfish biological organisms - are unclear. Theory
      suggests that enforcement mechanisms, which punish misbehaviour, may act
      to stabilise such interactions by resolving conflict. However, how such
      mechanisms can emerge in a nascent endosymbiosis has yet to be explored.
      Here, we propose that endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions, arising from
      digestion of the endosymbiont population, can result in a cost to host
      growth for breakdown of the endosymbiosis. Using the model nascent
      endosymbiosis, Paramecium bursaria - Chlorella spp., we demonstrate that
      this mechanism is dependent on the host RNA-interference (RNAi) system. We
      reveal through small RNA (sRNA) sequencing that endosymbiont-derived mRNA
      released upon endosymbiont digestion can be processed by the host RNAi
      system into 23-nt sRNA. We predict multiple regions of shared sequence
      identity between endosymbiont and host mRNA, and demonstrate through
      delivery of synthetic endosymbiont sRNA that exposure to these regions can
      knock-down expression of complementary host genes, resulting in a cost to
      host growth. This process of host gene knock-down in response to
      endosymbiont-derived RNA processing by host RNAi factors, which we term
      'RNAi-collisions', represents a mechanism which can promote stability in a
      nascent eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis. By imposing a cost for
      breakdown of the endosymbiosis, endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions may
      drive maintenance of the symbiosis across fluctuating ecological
      conditions and symbiotic status. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Stable
      endosymbiosis between eukaryotic microbes has driven the evolution of
      further cellular complexity. Yet the mechanisms which can act to stabilise
      a nascent eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis are unclear. Using the model
      nascent endosymbiotic system, Paramecium bursaria-Chlorella, we
      demonstrate that endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions can drive a cost
      to host growth upon endosymbiont digestion, punishing the host for
      misbehaviour. These RNA-RNA interactions are facilitated by the host
      RNA-interference system. For endosymbiont mRNA sharing a high-level of
      sequence identity with host transcripts, this process can result in host
      gene knock-down. We propose that these endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA
      interactions-'RNAi collisions'-represent a viable enforcement mechanism to
      sanction the host for breakdown of the endosymbiosis, promoting the
      stability of a nascent endosymbiotic interaction."

    abstract: Recent advances in multi-electrode array technology have made it
      possible to monitor large neuronal ensembles at high resolution. In
      humans, however, current approaches either restrict recordings to only a
      few neurons per penetrating electrode or combine the signals of thousands
      of neurons in local field potential (LFP) recordings. Here, we describe a
      set of techniques which enable simultaneous recording from over 200
      well-isolated cortical single units in human participants during
      intraoperative neurosurgical procedures using Neuropixels silicon probes.
      We characterized a diversity of extracellular waveforms with eight
      separable single unit classes, with differing firing rates, positions
      along the length of the linear electrode array, spatial spread of the
      waveform, and modulation by LFP events such as inter-ictal discharges and
      burst suppression. While some additional challenges remain in creating a
      turn-key system capable of recording, Neuropixels technology could pave
      the way to studying human-specific cognitive processes and their
      dysfunction at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.

    title: Heritable functional architecture in human visual cortex
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: How much of the functional organization of our visual system is
      inherited? Here we tested the heritability of retinotopic maps in human
      visual cortex using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We demonstrate
      that retinotopic organization shows a closer correspondence in monozygotic
      (MZ) compared to dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs, suggesting a partial genetic
      determination. Using population receptive field (pRF) analysis to examine
      the preferred spatial location and selectivity of these neuronal
      populations, we estimate a heritability around 30% for polar angle
      preferences and spatial selectivity, as quantified by pRF size, in
      extrastriate areas V2 and V3. Our findings are consistent with
      heritability in both the macroscopic arrangement of visual regions and
      stimulus tuning properties of visual cortex. This could constitute a
      neural substrate for variations in a range of perceptual effects, which
      themselves have been found to be at least partially genetically
      determined. These findings also add convergent evidence for the hypothesis
      that functional map topology is linked with cortical morphology.

    title: Evidence that pain sensitivity is rhythmic in humans, mainly driven by
      the endogenous circadian system and little by sleep
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: >-
      Pain intensity has been reported to fluctuate during the day in some
      experimental and clinical conditions, but the mechanisms underlying these
      fluctuations are unknown. Although the circadian timing system is known to
      regulate a wide range of physiological functions, its implication in pain
      regulation is unknown. We show here, using highly controlled laboratory
      constant routine conditions, that pain sensitivity is rhythmic over the
      24-hours and strongly controlled by the endogenous circadian timing
      system. We find that pain sensitivity follows a sinusoidal circadian
      rhythmicity, with a maximum in the middle of the night and a minimum in
      the afternoon. We also find a weak homeostatic control of pain
      sensitivity, with a linear increase over the 34 hours of prolonged
      wakefulness, which parallels that of sleep pressure. Using mathematical
      modelling, we describe that the circadian system accounts for 80% of the
      full magnitude of pain sensitivity over the 24 hours, and that
      sleep-related processes account for only 20%. This result reveals that
      nocturnal analgesia is predominantly induced by the circadian system and
      has been wrongly attributed only to sleep. Our findings highlight the need
      to consider the time of day in pain assessment, and suggest that
      personalized circadian medicine may be a promising approach to pain
      management.


      Significance statementWe discovered that sensitivity to pain is rhythmic in healthy humans, that sensitivity is maximal at night and minimal in the afternoon. Contrarily to the current thinking that sleep is the best painkiller, we find that the 24-h rhythmicity of sensitivity to pain is mainly controlled by a biological circadian clock in our body, and very little by our sleep. Our article reveals the neurobiological mechanisms involved in driving the rhythmicity of pain perception in humans, with the main time-piece located in the brain (the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus). Our findings challenge the current vision of pain physiology, and reveal the need to consider time-of-day and internal biological time for pain evaluation and pain management.

      I think an argument could be made for both a similar and different
      profile, but I would predict that the profiles would be the same between
      hot/cold pain modalities. I'm not sure if the same would stand for
      mechnical/electric/chemical pain, however.


      Another question I have for you is why you chose to only examine males in this study?

    title: MRI of Capn15 knockout mice and analysis of Capn15 distribution reveal
      possible roles in brain development and plasticity
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: The Small Optic Lobe (SOL) family of calpains are intracellular
      cysteine proteases that are expressed in the nervous system and play an
      important role in neuronal development in both Drosophila, where loss of
      this calpain leads to the eponymous small optic lobes, and in mouse and
      human, where loss of this calpain leads to eye anomalies. Some human
      individuals with biallelic variants in CAPN15 also have developmental
      delay and autism. However, neither the specific effect of the loss of the
      Capn15 protein on brain development nor the brain regions where this
      calpain is expressed in the adult is known. Here we show using small
      animal MRI that mice with the complete loss of Capn15 have smaller brains
      overall with larger decreases in the thalamus and subregions of the
      hippocampus. These losses are not seen in Capn15 conditional KO mice where
      Capn15 is knocked out only in excitatory neurons in the adult. Based on
      {beta}-galactosidase expression in an insert strain where lacZ is
      expressed under the control of the Capn15 promoter, we show that Capn15 is
      expressed in adult mice, particularly in neurons involved in plasticity
      such as the hippocampus, lateral amygdala and Purkinje neurons, and
      partially in other non-characterized cell types. The regions of the brain
      in the adult where Capn15 is expressed do not correspond well to the
      regions of the brain most affected by the complete knockout suggesting
      distinct roles of Capn15 in brain development and adult brain function.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    title: Homolog of ELAC2 is a central regulator of the mitochondrial unfolded
      protein response
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) has emerged as a
      predominant mechanism that preserves mitochondrial function. Consequently,
      multiple pathways likely exist to modulate UPRmt. We unexpectedly
      discovered that the tRNA processing enzyme, homolog of ELAC2 (HOE-1), is
      central to UPRmt regulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that
      nuclear HOE-1 is necessary and sufficient to robustly activate UPRmt. We
      show that HOE-1 acts via transcription factors ATFS-1 and DVE-1 that are
      crucial for UPRmt. Mechanistically, we show that HOE-1 likely mediates its
      effects via tRNAs, as blocking tRNA export prevents HOE-1-induced UPRmt.
      Interestingly, we find that HOE-1 does not act via the integrated stress
      response, which can be activated by uncharged tRNAs, pointing towards its
      reliance on a new mechanism. Finally, we show that the subcellular
      localization of HOE-1 is responsive to mitochondrial stress and is subject
      to negative regulation via ATFS-1. Together, we have discovered a novel
      RNA-based cellular pathway that modulates UPRmt.

    title: Analysis of scientific journalism in Nature reveals gender and regional
      disparities in coverage
    category: scientific-communication-and-education
    abstract: "Scientific journalism is a critical way in which the public can
      remain informed and benefit from new scientific findings. Such journalism
      also shapes the public's view of the current state of scientific findings
      and legitimizes experts. Those covering science can only cite and quote a
      limited number of sources. Sources may be identified by the journalist's
      research or by recommendations by other scientists. In both cases, biases
      may influence who is identified and ultimately included as an expert. We
      analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature to quantify
      possible disparities. Our analysis considered three possible sources of
      disparity: gender, name origin, and country affiliation. To explore these
      sources of disparity, we extracted cited authors' names and affiliations,
      as well as extracted names of quoted speakers. While citations and
      quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering
      process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible
      sources. We then used the extracted names to predict gender and name
      origin of the cited authors and speakers. In order to appropriately
      quantify the level of difference, we must identify a suitable reference
      set for comparison. We chose first and last authors within primary
      research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in
      the same time period as our comparator. In our analysis, we found a skew
      towards male quotation in Nature journalism-related articles, but
      quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than
      first and last authorship in academic publishing. Interestingly, we found
      that the gender disparity in quotes was column-dependent, with the
      \"Career Features\" column reaching gender parity. Our name origin
      analysis found a significant over-representation of names with predicted
      Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted
      East Asian origin. This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and
      journal citations, but dampened in citations. Finally, we performed an
      analysis to identify how countries vary in the way that they're described
      in scientific journalism. We focused on two groups of countries: countries
      that are often mentioned in articles, but do not often have affiliated
      authors cited, and countries that have affiliated authors that are often
      cited, but the country is not typically mentioned. We found that the
      articles in which the less cited countries occur tend to have more
      agricultural, extraction-related, and political terms, whereas articles
      including highly cited countries have broader scientific terms. This
      discrepancy indicates a possible lack of regional diversity in the
      reporting of scientific output."

    raw_message: Really interesting preprint! May I ask for a clarification point?
      If I understood correctly, you are checking for divergence from  the
      "demographic makeup of  the scientists who publish their primary research
      in Nature" (and specifically, last authors). Yet it has been shown that
      this demographic (i.e. scientists that are published by Nature) is itself
      biased. E.g. Abdill 2020 10.7554/eLife.58496 showing that several Nature
      titles disproportionately publish research from the united states. It is
      also possible to imagine bias towards Western authors given Nature's
      publishing model/fees etc.. Doesn't this suggest that the biases in Nature
      journalism, with respect to global science, are likely even stronger than
      what measured? I.e. Nature journalism over-represents English/men authors
      compared to a reference that already over-represents them, and
      underrepresents East-Asian/women authors compared to a reference that
      already under-represents them? I would be really interested in hearing
      your thoughts on this point.

    title: "Clearing the fog: Is HCQ effective in reducing COVID-19 progression: A
      randomized controlled trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: >-
      BackgroundHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been considered to treat
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but data on efficacy is conflicting.
      we analyzed the efficacy of HCQ) in addition to standard of care (SOC)
      compared with SOC alone in reducing disease progression in Mild COVID-19


      MethodsA single centre open label randomized controlled trial during 10th April to 31st May 2020 was conducted at Pak emirates Military Hospital (PEMH) Five hundred patients of both genders having age between 18-80 years with Mild COVID-19 were enrolled. Patients assigned to standard dose of HCQ plus SOC were 349 while 151 patients received SOC (control group). Primary outcome was progression of disease while secondary outcome was PCR negativity on day 7 and 14. The results were analyzed on SPSS version 23. P value <0.05 was considered significant.


      ResultsMedian age of intervention group (34 {+/-} 11.778 years) and control group (34 {+/-} 9.813 years). Disease progressed in 16 patients, 11 (3.15%) were in intervention group as compared to 5 (3.35%) in control group, (P value = 0.865). PCR negativity in intervention and control groups were (day 7, 182 (52.1%) vs. 54 (35.7%) (P value = 0.001), (day 14, 244 (69.9%) vs. 110 (72.8%) (P value = 0.508). Consecutive PCR negativity at day 7 and 14 was observed in 240 (68.8%) in intervention group compared to 108 (71.5%) in control group. (P value = 0.231).


      ConclusionAddition of HCQ to SOC in Mild COVID-19 neither stops disease progression nor help in early and sustained viral clearance.

    abstract: With the advance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the outlook for overcoming
      the global COVID-19 pandemic has improved. However, understanding of
      immunity and protection offered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines against
      circulating variants of concern (VOC) is rapidly evolving. We investigated
      the mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses against the referent WIV04
      (Wuhan) strain, circulating variants, and human endemic coronaviruses in
      168 naive and previously infected people at three-time points. Samples
      were collected prior to vaccination, after the first and after the second
      doses of one of the two available mRNA-based vaccines. After full
      vaccination, both naive and previously infected participants developed
      comparable robust SARS-CoV-2 specific spike IgG levels, modest IgM and IgA
      binding antibodies, and varying degrees of HCoV cross-reactive antibodies.
      However, the strength and frequency of neutralizing antibodies produced in
      naive people were significantly lower than in the previously infected
      group. We also found that 1/3rd of previously infected people had
      undetectable neutralizing antibodies after the first vaccine dose; 40% of
      this group developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose. In all
      subjects neutralizing antibodies produced against the B.1.351 and P.1
      variants were weaker than those produced against the reference and B.1.1.7
      strains. Our findings provide support for future booster vaccinations
      modified to be active against the circulating variants.

      process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible
      sources. We then used the extracted names to predict gender and name
      origin of the cited authors and speakers. In order to appropriately
      quantify the level of difference, we must identify a suitable reference
      set for comparison. We chose first and last authors within primary
      research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in
      the same time period as our comparator. In our analysis, we found a skew
      towards male quotation in Nature journalism-related articles, but
      quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than
      first and last authorship in academic publishing. Interestingly, we found
      that the gender disparity in quotes was column-dependent, with the
      \"Career Features\" column reaching gender parity. Our name origin
      analysis found a significant over-representation of names with predicted
      Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted
      East Asian origin. This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and
      journal citations, but dampened in citations. Finally, we performed an
      analysis to identify how countries vary in the way that they're described
      in scientific journalism. We focused on two groups of countries: countries
      that are often mentioned in articles, but do not often have affiliated
      authors cited, and countries that have affiliated authors that are often
      cited, but the country is not typically mentioned. We found that the
      articles in which the less cited countries occur tend to have more
      agricultural, extraction-related, and political terms, whereas articles
      including highly cited countries have broader scientific terms. This
      discrepancy indicates a possible lack of regional diversity in the
      reporting of scientific output."

      Hi Stefano! Thanks for your interest in our work! You bring up an
      excellent point that <i>Nature</i> publications are likely a biased sample
      of the scientific community. We partially address this in some of our
      supplementary analyses, mainly supplementary figures 2A and 4. We took an
      additional comparative dataset of a random subset of papers published by
      <i>Springer Nature</i>. In these analyses, we observe what you suspected
      in your comment -- the disparity may be more significant when comparing
      against other journals. 


      For our predicted gender analysis, we find that authorship in <i>Springer Nature</i> is closer to parity than <i>Nature</i>, but still far from parity. We also found that the proportion of predicted male quotes has a larger disparity than first authors in <i>Springer Nature</i>.


      Regarding our predicted name origin analysis, let's look at supplementary figures 4 C and D. Here, when we compare springer last author vs. nature last author, we find springer last authors to be much more diverse. Specifically looking at the "East Asian" last author name origins, we see that <i>Springer Nature</i> last authors make up between 10-40%, whereas Nature last authors only make up between 15-25%.


      An additional experiment would be to take multiple journals based in various countries, have multiple estimated impact factors, any other parameters that may be important, and perform the comparisons. The biggest problem with this, is that not all journals make this information readily available. If I were to do this, I would try to additionally pick journals published within <i>Springer Nature</i>, since their API is easy to use.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    title: "Casirivimab and imdevimab in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19
      (RECOVERY): a randomised, controlled, open-label, platform trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: REGEN-COV is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies
      (casirivimab and imdevimab) that bind to two different sites on the
      receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We aimed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of REGEN-COV in patients admitted to
      hospital with COVID-19. Methods: In this randomised, controlled,
      open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with
      usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Eligible and consenting
      patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual standard of care
      alone (usual care group) or usual care plus a single dose of REGEN-COV 8g
      (casirivimab 4g and imdevimab 4g) by intravenous infusion (REGEN-COV
      group). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed first among
      patients without detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at randomisation
      (seronegative) and then in the overall population. Findings: Between 18
      September 2020 and 22 May 2021, 9785 patients were randomly allocated to
      receive usual care plus REGEN-COV or usual care alone, including 3153
      (32%) seronegative patients, 5272 (54%) seropositive patients and 1360
      (14%) patients with unknown baseline antibody status. In the primary
      efficacy population of seronegative patients, 396 (24%) of 1633 patients
      allocated to REGEN-COV and 451 (30%) of 1520 patients allocated to usual
      care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.70-0.91; p=0.0010). In
      an analysis involving all randomised patients (regardless of baseline
      antibody status), 944 (20%) of 4839 patients allocated to REGEN-COV and
      1026 (21%) of 4946 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days
      (rate ratio 0.94; 95% CI 0.86-1.03; p=0.17). The proportional effect of
      REGEN-COV on mortality differed significantly between seropositive and
      seronegative patients (p value for heterogeneity = 0.001). Interpretation:
      In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, the monoclonal antibody
      combination of casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV) reduced 28-day
      mortality among patients who were seronegative at baseline."

    title: Recovery of deleted deep sequencing data sheds more light on the early
      Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains shrouded in mystery.
      Here I identify a data set containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in
      the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH's Sequence Read
      Archive. I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud, and
      reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic
      analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing
      data suggests that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences that are the focus
      of the joint WHO-China report are not fully representative of the viruses
      in Wuhan early in the epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of known
      SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the
      market viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-2's bat coronavirus
      relatives.

      March, 2020. Both a preprint, and a later paper (by Wang et al.), were
      publicly available describing these sequences, including key aspects of
      their genomic features. However, independently of the preprint or paper,
      which make no direct reference to an NCBI submission, the sequences  been
      marked for deletion on NCBI, but were re-obtained by Bloom via internet
      backups of the data. While sharing more genomic data from the early
      epidemic can be valuable, I believe the current version of this work makes
      several errors that are important to address in both scientific content
      and critically, in scientific communication.



      In general, the work is vague or remiss about extremely important context and details about the sequences in question. To begin, the genomes obtained are consistently referred throughout the title and abstract (and indeed most of the text) as being from the "early" epidemic. This terminology is too vague, as it may invite the reader to assume that the genomes include  the earliest cases known - in fact, they are not, and were originally reported by Wang et al. 2020 to be from January 2020. Over 25 genomes had previously been obtained during 2019 for SARS-CoV-2. To properly interpret the context of this work, an emphasis on the timing is critical and should not be avoided in the abstract or title. 



      Secondly, the abstract and title both strongly give the inaccurate impression that the re-obtained sequences alone newly demonstrate that the known and reported genetic diversity of viruses in the Huanan market was not representative of all circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants at the time. This is alluded to in the title, which says they "shed more light" on the early epidemic. Yet, this is not supported by the data in the manuscript: it was already known that the genetic diversity of viruses obtained from Huanan market cases was not representative of all genetic variants circulating at that time.  As can be seen most clearly in Figs 3 and 5, the new sequences obtained were not completely unique in sequence or unusual in case timing. There were already several reported publicly available similar genomes with for the most part identical sequences from the early epidemic. The author is certainly aware of this, as it is evident from the data presented and from the works cited (both Garry 2021 and Kumar et al. 2021 discuss this at length), but this key point is not emphasized in the title or abstract, and indeed is a  weakness of the importance of the work itself. 



      Thirdly, in the introduction the work makes several key omissions about the timing of cases. The introduction directly suggests that the Huanan market is unlikely to be a site of zoonosis because a number of early cases could not be confirmed to be connected to the market; However, this was true of SARS-CoV-1 in Fushan as well. The author also neglects to mention that a significant fraction of cases were connected to *other* markets in the city, including the earliest cases (as described in the WHO report). And indeed, if there were multiple spillover events, e.g. from a shared wildlife supply chain that connected multiple markets throughout the city, even with perfect contact tracing data one would not expect all cases to be connected to one market.



      Fourthly, I believe the inclusion of Figure 2 in this paper is highly unprofessional and misleading. This is a screenshot of an email from a scientist who is not associated with the papers or data described in the data; indeed, the only relevance between them seems to be a shared nationality of the author(s). Additionally, as of June 2021 the data described as 'deleted' in this screenshot is publicly available again on NCBI. While I understand that Bloom likely did not realize this mistake, it is difficult to justify the inclusion of this figure in a scientific work. 




      Fifthly, and perhaps most importantly, I think the previous point happens to provide a fortuitous lesson about a key error that Bloom makes in assuming misconduct on the part of the Wang et al. 2020 authors. He writes "It therefore seems the sequences were deleted to obscure their existence". It is implicitly assumed that Bloom believed that to also be true of the data described in Figure 2 - hence its inclusion - but its recent re-publication on NCBI makes it abundantly clear that was not the case. To be honest, this is not surprising. Claims of scientific misconduct made from a distance, without knowledge of the details and circumstance surrounding the issue, have the potential to appear convincing despite having perfectly ordinary (or perhaps slightly less than ideal, but not nefarious) scientific rationale. 




      Similarly, there is also evidence that scientific misconduct is also highly unlikely to be the case with the dataset that is described in this paper. Primarily, this is because the paper describing these sequences  was published in a journal several months later. If the authors were indeed trying to obscure their data, they would simply also not publish their paper in a public journal, or request it to not be published after submitting for review. If these sequences were removed for the purpose of obscurity, it is also worth noting that such an effort clearly flopped - because as described above, these sequences do not immediately provide any completely new knowledge about the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in the early pandemic. In both the preprint and the paper (the first submitted before data removal; the second published likely after), no mention of a BioProject accession is made, and instead it is said that the data is available upon reasonable request from the authors. If the writers initially intended for the data to be made public, standard practice would have included the BioProject reference (or even a placeholder) in the text. The fact that there was never such a reference makes it quite evident that there likely was a miscommunication between co-authors about whether the data was intended to be released to NCBI. 




      The reality is that minor scientific missteps and less-than-ideal circumstances surround the sharing of scientific data all of the time. The process of publishing on scientific data is fraught with tiny details and hard work, the trainees responsible for it are often overworked, and there are often unfortunate but relatively ordinary scientific incentives to avoid making as much data public as should be. The rationale behind what data is and is not shared for scientific works are often nuanced, and sometimes quite personal. The scientific process would be better if it were not the case, but these forces are almost universal, and everyone encounters them in scientific work. In this circumstance, like in the circumstance outlined in Figure 2 of this work, these ordinary forces of scientific circumstance are almost certainly more likely the case than direct censorship or misconduct. It is unfortunate and alarming that this work as it currently stands baselessly contributes to an environment where many readers assume the latter depending on the country of origin of the original authors.




      Minor point: 


      At the bottom of page 5: "But although there are unusual aspects of RatG13's primary sequencing data". This statement is vague, the language is unscientific, and many interpretations of it would not be supported by the citations provided. I would recommend that Bloom change this sentence to present a coherent scientific statement if indeed there is a point about genome quality to be made there that is relevant to the text.

    title: Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank
    category: neurology
    abstract: There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19,
      some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast
      majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative,
      gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on
      hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of
      COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated
      manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of
      the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021
      hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit.
      Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal
      data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study,
      with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection
      between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans
      from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes
      between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for
      age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant
      effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left
      parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left
      insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results
      extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and
      temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been
      hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were
      not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19
      vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey
      matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and
      hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|>3). Our findings thus consistently
      relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to
      the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease
      studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the
      danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being
      mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the
      virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and
      the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo
      hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory
      and gustatory pathways.

    title: RNA silencing by CRISPR in plants does not require Cas13
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas can provide potential advantages over DNA
      editing, such as avoiding pleiotropic effects of genome editing, providing
      precise spatiotemporal regulation and expanded function including
      anti-viral immunity. Here, we report the use of CRISPR-Cas13 in plants to
      reduce both viral and endogenous RNA. Unexpectedly, we discovered that
      crRNA designed to guide Cas13 could, in the absence of the Cas13 protein,
      cause substantial reduction in RNA levels as well. We demonstrate
      Cas13-independent guide-induced gene silencing (GIGS) in three plant
      species, including stable transgenic Arabidopsis. We determined that GIGS
      utilizes endogenous RNAi machinery despite the fact that crRNA are unlike
      canonical triggers of RNAi such as miRNA, hairpins or long double-stranded
      RNA. These results suggest that GIGS offers a novel and flexible approach
      to RNA reduction with potential benefits over existing technologies for
      crop improvement. Our results demonstrate that GIGS is active across a
      range of plant species, evidence similar to recent findings in an insect
      system, which suggests that GIGS is potentially active across many
      eukaryotes.

      Interesting. I like the work. Just as you write, folks generally do not
      include the Cas- or gRNA/crRNA-only controls anymore. This was done back
      when CRISPR took off but it has largely been dropped. 


      I wonder about the sRNA sequencing. Did you observe the intact DR + spacer in the reads, or only the processed forms? It looks like your library prep protocol would have excluded larger fragments. You mention the reads are 21-24 nt in length, but which part of the DR+spacer does that contain? Is it a single species? Or spread out across the 28-nt spacer? 


      sRNAs should be produced along the entire length of your TRV vectors. Maybe what you are observing with the viral work is just the production of a functional siRNA from the viral RNA (standard VIGS) and not from a crRNA? Unless I missed it, all the results show that the presence of the crRNA vector is sufficient, but is there evidence that expression of the crRNA is required? I'm curious what would happen if you removed the U6 promoter and/or the DR. Or change the initiating nucleotide. That could establish that GIGS requires crRNA expression and not just presence.

    title: Sword of Damocles or choosing well. Population genetics sheds light into
      the future of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 new mutant strains.
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Abstract An immense scientific effort has been made worldwide due to
      Covid-19s pandemic magnitude. It has made possible to identify almost
      300,000 SARS-CoV-2 different genetic variants, connecting them with
      clinical and epidemiological findings. Among this immense data collection,
      that constitutes the biggest evolutionary experiment in history, is buried
      the answer to what will happen in the future. Will new strains, more
      contagious than the current ones or resistant to the vaccines, arise by
      mutation? Although theoretic population genetics is, by far, the most
      powerful tool we have to do an accurate prediction, it has been barely
      used for the study of SARS-CoV-2 due to its conceptual difficulty. Having
      in mind that the size of the SARS-CoV-2 population is astronomical we can
      apply a discrete treatment, based on the branching process method,
      Fokker-Plank equations and Kolmogoroffs forward equations, to calculate
      the survival likelihood through time, to elucidate the likelihood to
      become dominant genotypes and how long will this take, for new SARS-CoV-2
      mutants depending on their selective advantage. Results show that most of
      the new mutants that will arise in the SARS-CoV-2 meta-population will
      stay at very low frequencies. However, some few new mutants, significantly
      more infectious than current ones, will still emerge and become dominant
      in the population favoured by a great selective advantage. Far from
      showing a mutational meltdown, SARS-CoV-2 meta-population will increase
      its fitness becoming more infective. There is a probability, small but
      finite, that new mutants arise resistant to some vaccines. High infected
      numbers and slow vaccination programs will significantly increase this
      likelihood.

      pre-print. I am willing to go through this paper and make corrections, but
      I can also imagine a simple Word document Spelling and Grammer check would
      also be a place to start. As an example, just try reading the paragraphs
      prior to the endnotes from "4. Muller’s ratchet, 'mutational meltdown' and
      fundamental principle of natural selection" on. You will encounter 'led'
      which should be spelled 'lead', two non-sentences in a row, the word
      'where' which was probably supposed to be 'were', which would have made
      one of those phrases an actual sentence and more. Sadly, as I read this
      informative document, every time I came across these errors, I cringed at
      how it ever reached this stage with so many stumbling blocks to a proper
      English read!

    abstract: >-
      Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids (VIPP1) is essential for the
      biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes, which transform light
      into life. However, it is unknown how VIPP1 performs its vital
      membrane-shaping function. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to
      determine structures of cyanobacterial VIPP1 rings, revealing how VIPP1
      monomers flex and interweave to form basket-like assemblies of different
      symmetries. Three VIPP1 monomers together coordinate a non-canonical
      nucleotide binding pocket that is required for VIPP1 oligomerization.
      Inside the ring's lumen, amphipathic helices from each monomer align to
      form large hydrophobic columns, enabling VIPP1 to bind and curve
      membranes. In vivo point mutations in these hydrophobic surfaces cause
      extreme thylakoid swelling under high light, indicating an essential role
      of VIPP1 lipid binding in resisting stress-induced damage. Our study
      provides a structural basis for understanding how the oligomerization of
      VIPP1 drives the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes and protects these
      life-giving membranes from environmental stress.

    title: Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.617.2 variant
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: The B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant has contributed to the
      surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe,
      including a notable increase in cases in the UK. We estimate the
      effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against this
      variant. Methods: A test negative case control design was used to estimate
      the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both
      variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases
      identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all
      symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate
      the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain
      (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status. Results: Effectiveness was notably lower
      after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3)
      compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results
      for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 93.4%
      (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with
      B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI:
      54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2.
      Sequenced cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had a higher
      odds of infection with B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40;
      95%CI: 1.13-1.75). Conclusions: After 2 doses of either vaccine there were
      only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2
      variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked
      with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with two doses
      among vulnerable groups."

    title: "Face masks to prevent transmission of respiratory diseases: Systematic
      review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Objectives. To examine the effect of face mask intervention in
      respiratory infections across different exposure settings and age groups.
      Design. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources. PubMed,
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were
      searched for randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of face
      masks on respiratory infections published by November 18th 2020. We
      followed PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies.
      Randomized controlled trials investigating face masks in respiratory
      infections across different exposure settings. Two reviewers performed the
      search, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Random effects
      meta-analysis with risk ratio, adjusted odds ratios, and number needed to
      treat were performed. Findings by source control or wearer protection, age
      groups, exposure settings, and role of non-compliance were evaluated.
      Results. Seventeen studies were included, (N=11,601 cases and N=10,286
      controls, follow-up from 4 days to 19 months). Fourteen trials included
      adults and children and three trials included children only. Twelve
      studies showed non-compliance in treatment and eleven in control group.
      Four studies supported the use of face masks. Meta-analysis across all
      studies with risk ratios found no association with number of infections
      (RR=0.957 [0.810 - 1.131], p=0.608). Meta-analysis using odds ratios
      adjusted for age, sex, and vaccination (when available) showed protective
      effect of face masks (OR=0.850 [0.736 - 0.982], p=0.027). Subgroup
      meta-analysis with adjusted odds ratios found a decrease in respiratory
      infections among adults (14 studies, OR = 0.829 [0.709-0.969], p=0.019) in
      source control setting (OR = 0.845 [0.7375 - 0.969], p=0.0159) and when
      face masks were used together with hand hygiene OR = 0.690 [0.568 -
      0.838], p=0.0002). Overall between-study heterogeneity was large also in
      the subgroup analyses. Conclusion. Despite the large between study
      heterogeneity, compliance bias and differences by environmental settings,
      the findings support the use of face masks to prevent respiratory
      infections. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020205523.

      It seems that the Adjusted Odds Ratios are not all adjusted for covariates
      but are Crude Odds Ratios. This is for at least Macintyre 2015 and 2016
      and Aiello 2010 and 2012 papers.


      It is worth noting that even some of these are erroneous as for example Aiello et al. 2010 subtracted individuals with previous respiratory infections and therefore the intervention groups for mask and hand hygiene were actually 316 (367 in Ollila et al.) and for the mask only 347 (378 in Ollila et al.). As previously reported to Ollila et al for their first version (published 8/2020) if the aim is to define the effect of the mask as intervention using the results from both intervention groups does not render robust results.


      Also, for the Abdin et al. 2005 paper the original intervention groups were 257 (mask and Health Education booklet), 292 (HE booklet only) and 446 (control). It is apparent that Ollila et al. used the compliance within the groups as redefining the groups: mask+HE booklet compliance 81.3% (209), HE booklet group compliance 51.7% (151) and control group using masks 33.6% (150). New intervention group 150+151+209=510 and control 995-510=485. Abdin et al. only reported the adjusted OR with these compliance based groups and no RR or OR based on the original Randomised Control Trial protocol. As Ollila et al. is by the authors a systematic review and meta-analysis of Randomised Control Trials these results should not be used as they have.


      More, from the Simmerman et al. 2011 Ollila et al. chose only the Influenza Like Illness (ILI) results for their meta-analysis even though Simmerman et al. also reported PCR confirmed infections. For the sub-analysis with Adjusted Odds Ratios Ollila et al. preferred to use the PCR confirmed results from the same paper with OR 1.16 (95% CI 0.74-1.82) instead of the ILI results that were OR 2.15 (95% CI 1.27-3.62). The latter would push the pooled result much more towards the null hypothesis.


      The same goes for the Cowling et al. 2009 where the authors reported respiratory infections based on three criteria: RT-PCR confirmed, Clinical definition 1 (2 symptoms) and Clinical definition 2 (3 symptoms). Ollila et al. only used the Clinical definition 2 results for their meta-analysis.


      With these and all previously reported research flaws one can only conclude that the conclusions of Ollila et al. are not supported by the results if calculated correctly.

    title: "Precision Medicine Approach to Alzheimer's Disease: Successful
      Proof-of-Concept Trial"
    category: neurology
    abstract: "Abstract Importance: Effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease
      and mild cognitive impairment are needed. Objective: To determine whether
      a precision medicine approach to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive
      impairment, in which potential contributors to cognitive decline are
      identified and targeted therapeutically, is effective enough in a
      proof-of-concept trial to warrant a larger, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial. Rationale: Previous clinical trials for Alzheimer's
      disease have pre-determined a single treatment modality, such as a drug
      candidate or therapeutic procedure, that may be unrelated to the primary
      drivers of the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, increasing data set
      size to include the potential contributors to cognitive decline for each
      patient, and addressing the identified potential contributors, may
      represent a more effective therapeutic strategy. Hypothesis: Alzheimer's
      disease is a multi-factorial network dysfunction that results from a
      chronic or repeated insufficiency of support for a neuroplasticity
      network; thus factors that increase demand -- such as infections or toxin
      exposure -- or reduce support -- such as reduced energetics or trophic
      support -- may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. Rectifying
      this hypothesized network dysfunction represents a rational approach to
      the treatment of the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease
      and mild cognitive impairment. Design: Twenty-five patients with
      Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, with Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA) scores of 19 or higher, were evaluated for markers of
      inflammation, chronic infection, dysbiosis, insulin resistance, protein
      glycation, vascular disease, nocturnal hypoxemia, hormone insufficiency or
      dysregulation, nutrient deficiency, toxin or toxicant exposure (metals,
      organic toxicants, and biotoxins), genetic predisposition to cognitive
      decline, and other biochemical parameters associated with cognitive
      decline. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetrics was performed
      at baseline and study conclusion. Patients were treated for nine months
      with a personalized, precision medicine protocol that addressed each
      patient's identified potentially contributory factors, and cognition was
      assessed at t = 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. Trial registration and IRB
      approval: The clinical trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
      (NCT03883633), 1 and approved by the Advarra IRB. Support for the trial:
      The trial was supported by a grant from the Four Winds Foundation via
      Evanthea, LLC, and we are grateful to Diana Merriam and Gayle Brown for
      their interest, discussions, and support. Main Outcome Measures: Trained
      external raters evaluated the study subjects with the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), CNS Vital Signs (a computerized cognitive assessment
      battery), AQ-21 (a subjective scale completed by the significant other or
      study partner), and AQ-C change scale (a subjective scale of cognitive
      improvement or decline, completed by the significant other or study
      partner). Follow-up brain MRI with volumetrics was carried out at the
      completion of the trial. Results: All outcome measures revealed
      improvement: statistically highly significant improvement in MoCA scores,
      CNS Vital Signs Neurocognitive Index, and AQ-C were documented. No serious
      adverse events were recorded. Conclusions and Relevance: Based on the
      cognitive improvements observed in this study of patients with Alzheimer's
      disease or mild cognitive impairment, a larger, randomized, controlled
      trial of the precision medicine therapeutic approach described herein is
      warranted."

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    title: Uncovering novel mutational signatures by de novo extraction with
      SigProfilerExtractor
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Mutational signature analysis is commonly performed in genomic studies
      surveying cancer and normal somatic tissues. Here we present
      SigProfilerExtractor, an automated tool for accurate de novo extraction of
      mutational signatures for all types of somatic mutations. Benchmarking
      with a total of 33 distinct scenarios encompassing 1,900 simulated
      signatures operative in more than 60,000 unique synthetic genomes
      demonstrates that SigProfilerExtractor outperforms thirteen other tools
      across all datasets with and without noise. For simulations with 5% noise,
      reflecting high-quality genomic datasets, SigProfilerExtractor outperforms
      other approaches by elucidating between 20% and 50% more true positive
      signatures while yielding more than 5-fold less false positive signatures.
      Applying SigProfilerExtractor to 2,778 whole-genome sequenced cancers
      reveals three previously missed mutational signatures. Two of the
      signatures are confirmed in independent cohorts with one of these
      signatures associating with tobacco smoking. In summary, this report
      provides a reference tool for analysis of mutational signatures, a
      comprehensive benchmarking of bioinformatics tools for extracting
      mutational signatures, and several novel mutational signatures including a
      signature putatively attributed to direct tobacco smoking mutagenesis in
      bladder cancer and in normal bladder epithelium.

    raw_message: Congratulations for this wonderful work! May I just make sure that
      our approach implemented in the signature.tools.lib package is used
      correctly? From the supplementary notes you provide it seems that the
      guidance for using our method is not followed. We advise using at least 20
      bootstraps with 200 repeats and filter of best runs with RTOL=0.001 (see
      “what parameters should I use for signature extraction”,
      https://github.com/Nik-Zainal-Group/signature.tools.lib#faq). However, in
      the supplementary notes it is stated that 100 bootstraps with no filter is
      used. Also, the default parameters shown in our package, in particular
      repeats=10 is only meant for testing, not for practical purposes, as at
      least 100 repeats are in general necessary for small medium problems.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics

      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      Yes, we looked high and low at different subgroups with different headers
      or covariates. We couldn't find anything. That statisticians then used a
      causal model, called Rubin, to determine what percent of the difference in
      survival was "caused" by higher doses of HCQ and AZM. 

      I understand the skepticism. I, at a minimum, hope people will rethink how they analyze HCQ/AZM data. As for pts in the ICU currently, I feel strongly HCQ/AZM at these higher doses should be used. You don't have much to lose. 

      I haven't run the numbers over the past 6-8 months. It appears fewer hospitalized Covid pts get intubated, but the survival rate for those intubated appears even worse than before. This is just an observation or guess, which is from talking with the ICU staff, who told me their opinion, and our own observations.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      I wish. I am a private practitioner and I "own" the Smith Center for
      Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. I worked hundreds of hours on this
      study. My hourly rate = $0,000.00 for Smith Center work. In other words,
      before Covid, my work at the Smith Center was not reimbursed.  

      So, I can't afford to spend much more time on this study. 

      Further, I don't have access to another set of data. 

      But clearly these data beg for others to look at their data similarly.

    abstract: The delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.617.2, emerged in India and has
      subsequently spread to over 80 countries. B.1.617.2 rapidly replaced
      B.1.1.7 as the dominant virus in the United Kingdom, resulting in a steep
      increase in new infections, and a similar development is expected for
      other countries. Effective countermeasures require information on
      susceptibility of B.1.617.2 to control by antibodies elicited by vaccines
      and used for COVID-19 therapy. We show, using pseudotyping, that B.1.617.2
      evades control by antibodies induced upon infection and BNT162b2
      vaccination, although with lower efficiency as compared to B.1.351.
      Further, we found that B.1.617.2 is resistant against Bamlanivimab, a
      monoclonal antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy.
      Finally, we show increased Calu-3 lung cell entry and enhanced
      cell-to-cell fusion of B.1.617.2, which may contribute to augmented
      transmissibility and pathogenicity of this variant. These results identify
      B.1.617.2 as an immune evasion variant with increased capacity to enter
      and fuse lung cells.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: "Precision Medicine Approach to Alzheimer's Disease: Successful
      Proof-of-Concept Trial"
    category: neurology
    abstract: "Abstract Importance: Effective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease
      and mild cognitive impairment are needed. Objective: To determine whether
      a precision medicine approach to Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive
      impairment, in which potential contributors to cognitive decline are
      identified and targeted therapeutically, is effective enough in a
      proof-of-concept trial to warrant a larger, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial. Rationale: Previous clinical trials for Alzheimer's
      disease have pre-determined a single treatment modality, such as a drug
      candidate or therapeutic procedure, that may be unrelated to the primary
      drivers of the neurodegenerative process. Therefore, increasing data set
      size to include the potential contributors to cognitive decline for each
      patient, and addressing the identified potential contributors, may
      represent a more effective therapeutic strategy. Hypothesis: Alzheimer's
      disease is a multi-factorial network dysfunction that results from a
      chronic or repeated insufficiency of support for a neuroplasticity
      network; thus factors that increase demand -- such as infections or toxin
      exposure -- or reduce support -- such as reduced energetics or trophic
      support -- may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. Rectifying
      this hypothesized network dysfunction represents a rational approach to
      the treatment of the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease
      and mild cognitive impairment. Design: Twenty-five patients with
      Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, with Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA) scores of 19 or higher, were evaluated for markers of
      inflammation, chronic infection, dysbiosis, insulin resistance, protein
      glycation, vascular disease, nocturnal hypoxemia, hormone insufficiency or
      dysregulation, nutrient deficiency, toxin or toxicant exposure (metals,
      organic toxicants, and biotoxins), genetic predisposition to cognitive
      decline, and other biochemical parameters associated with cognitive
      decline. Brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetrics was performed
      at baseline and study conclusion. Patients were treated for nine months
      with a personalized, precision medicine protocol that addressed each
      patient's identified potentially contributory factors, and cognition was
      assessed at t = 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. Trial registration and IRB
      approval: The clinical trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
      (NCT03883633), 1 and approved by the Advarra IRB. Support for the trial:
      The trial was supported by a grant from the Four Winds Foundation via
      Evanthea, LLC, and we are grateful to Diana Merriam and Gayle Brown for
      their interest, discussions, and support. Main Outcome Measures: Trained
      external raters evaluated the study subjects with the Montreal Cognitive
      Assessment (MoCA), CNS Vital Signs (a computerized cognitive assessment
      battery), AQ-21 (a subjective scale completed by the significant other or
      study partner), and AQ-C change scale (a subjective scale of cognitive
      improvement or decline, completed by the significant other or study
      partner). Follow-up brain MRI with volumetrics was carried out at the
      completion of the trial. Results: All outcome measures revealed
      improvement: statistically highly significant improvement in MoCA scores,
      CNS Vital Signs Neurocognitive Index, and AQ-C were documented. No serious
      adverse events were recorded. Conclusions and Relevance: Based on the
      cognitive improvements observed in this study of patients with Alzheimer's
      disease or mild cognitive impairment, a larger, randomized, controlled
      trial of the precision medicine therapeutic approach described herein is
      warranted."

      I won't get into the strengths and weaknesses of those studies. I will
      point a few things in general. You can't show a drug or therapy improves
      mortality when 98% of the control patients survive. 

      There is no RCT that looked at HCQ/AZM by cumulative dose or HCQ/AZM in critically ill pts. 

      I can get into the Brazil RCT with HCQ/AZM on mildly ill Covid pts, but that study has many, many problems, including a very high survival rate in all groups.

      Since this was an observational study with a small number of survivors,
      the fear is that you draw conclusions that are tied to survival and not to
      treatments.  Simply put...

      MDs won't prescribe HCQ/Zithro to certain risk pools.

      Cumulative dose may rise with survival, not the other way around.

      You've got 15% of the total population in the study on this regimen and 20% of the population survived.  If the MDs picked 10-15 of the 'least contraindicated' patients to do anything with, chances are that you'd see higher survival.


      Double blind, controlled or explain the heck out of the pooling and selection criteria.

    title: Predicting the mutational drivers of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: SARS-CoV-2 evolution threatens vaccine- and natural infection-derived
      immunity, and the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Herein we sought to
      predict Spike amino acid changes that could contribute to future variants
      of concern. We tested the importance of features comprising epidemiology,
      evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling.
      This resulted in identification of the primary biological drivers of
      SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that resistance to
      population-level host immunity has increasingly shaped SARS-CoV-2
      evolution over time. We identified with high accuracy mutations that will
      spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the
      pandemic. Behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal
      structure wherein epidemiological variables integrate the effects of
      diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to
      forecast mutations that will spread in the future, and characterize how
      these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These
      findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations
      that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. This
      modeling approach may be applied to any pathogen with genomic surveillance
      data, and so may address other rapidly evolving pathogens such as
      influenza, and unknown future pandemic viruses.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

    abstract: While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2,
      it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection
      influence the immune defense they elicit, and whether they protect against
      variants. Focusing on the T cell response, we conducted a longitudinal
      study of infection-naive and COVID-19 convalescent donors before
      vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses, using a
      high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T
      cells. Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to
      stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351
      variant strains, both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes. In
      infection-naive individuals, the second dose boosted the quantity but not
      quality of the T cell response, while in convalescents the second dose
      helped neither. Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees
      differed strikingly from those of infection-naive vaccinees, with
      phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability
      to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx. These results
      provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to the
      B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, confirm that convalescents may not need a
      second vaccine dose, and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have
      more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to
      their infection-naive counterparts.

    title: Policy and Effectiveness of Covid-19 Response
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: A comparative analysis of selected national jurisdictions with respect
      to Covid-19 policy response indicated that factors such as effective
      communications and effective targeted intervention in the environments of
      higher epidemiological risk can be the key factors in the overall
      effectiveness of the epidemiological response minimizing both the impact
      of the epidemics and disruptions in the life of the society.

    title: Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank
    category: neurology
    abstract: There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19,
      some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast
      majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative,
      gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on
      hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of
      COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated
      manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of
      the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start
      of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021
      hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit.
      Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal
      data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study,
      with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection
      between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans
      from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes
      between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for
      age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant
      effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left
      parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left
      insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results
      extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and
      temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been
      hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were
      not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19
      vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey
      matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and
      hippocampal cornu ammonis (all |Z|>3). Our findings thus consistently
      relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to
      the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease
      studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the
      danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being
      mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the
      virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and
      the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo
      hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory
      and gustatory pathways.

      Stress does not cause these specific patterns of brain damage. We know a
      lot about stress, and these do not look like the brain effects of stress
      even from more traumatic incidents.



      It's important not to have a panicked or credulous reaction to these results, but it's also important not to be overly skeptical when the evidence is clear and overwhelming that even mild cases of COVID cause specific patterns of brain damage.

    title: MONITORING SARS-COV-2 TRANSMISSION AND PREVALENCE IN POPULATIONS UNDER
      REPEATED TESTING
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: We describe a repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing model for monitoring and
      containing outbreaks in a residential community. The analysis is motivated
      by the Ohio State University (OSU) approach to monitoring disease at its
      Columbus, Ohio campus during the COVID-19 epidemic in autumn 2020. The
      model is simple, yet flexible enough to accommodate changes in be- havior
      over time and to eliminate bias due to a nonrandom testing scheme. Model
      parameters are estimated from individual results of weekly SARS- CoV-2
      testing of residents. Model output serves several purposes, including
      estimating the effective reproduction number and monitoring prevalence to
      help inform isolation and quarantine bed capacity. An extended version of
      the model is also considered where the residential population (on-campus
      students) is assumed to interact with another population for whom the
      testing regime is more relaxed and possibly less frequent (off-campus
      students or in- structional faculty and staff). To illustrate the model
      application, we analyze both the synthetic data as well as the actual
      student SARS-CoV-2 testing data collected at OSU Columbus campus.

      We hope that the methodology can be used in other situations when
      vaccination is not an option and repeated testing is requited.   Thanks to
      all who contributed to data collection for this project !

      Adjusting for weight does not solve an immortal time bias.   You can say
      it, but it's not correct.  When one has to survive long enough to receive
      5 days (Table 4) or 10 days of medicine (Figure 2), then you have created
      an immortal time bias.   


      Table 4 presents a Cox regression model.   As above, I stated that the correct analysis is a Cox-regression with a time-dependent covariate for HCQ use.  That is a different statistical model than just a "Cox model."   In using a time-dependent variable for HCQ use, that would minimize the immortal time bias. (There may be other biases, such as a selection bias where people on hospice did not receive aggressive therapy. That is an inherent problem with observational data).

      Cumulative dosing = immortal time bias.  

      1) To get to 3g of HCQ, one needs to survive 5 days at the max FDA-approved dose of 600mg/day.  

      2) For >80mg/kg of HCQ and >1g AZ), with an average weight of 89 kg and daily dose of 600mg/day that is ~6.7 mg/kg of HCQ per day on average. Thus to get to 80 mg/kg of HCQ, one needs to survive approx 12 days  (6.7*12 = 80).  Weights will be variable so maybe it's surviving 10-12 days.  Thus this comparison is comparing people who received a medicine for 10-12 days versus those who did not survive 10-12 days. That is why no one died before 10 days in the >80mg/kg HCQ group.  That is an immortal time bias.    


      As 88% of people received hydroxychloroquine and 80% overall died, this does not seem that impressive of a therapy.   You have presented an immortal time bias.  The correct statistical analysis is a time-dependent Cox Regression which would eliminate the immortal time bias problem.   I assume you know this, but if you do the correct analysis, it does not show what you want it to show. 


      Is Hydroxychloroquine + Azithromycin still used at your hospital at standard of care?

    title: Impact estimation on COVID-19 infections following school reopening in
      September 2020 in Italy
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Background Since its outbreak, CoViD-19 (formally known as 2019-nCoV)
      has been triggering many questions among public authorities, social
      organisms and school officials, as to when students should be allowed to
      return to school. Such a decision is critical and must take into account,
      other than its beneficial effects, also those associated with an increased
      exposition of the students to the virus, which, as a result, might spread
      at a faster rate. To date, in Italy, a few studies have rigorously
      investigated the correlation between school reopening and number of people
      tested positive to CoViD-19. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an
      assessment of such an impact as well as to illustrate the methodology
      followed. Methods Official daily data on the cumulative number of people
      tested positive to CoViD-19, in conjunction with external information
      accounting for the different points in time schools reopened in the
      various Italian regions, have been employed to build a stochastic model of
      the type Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average embodying external
      information. Results There was a statistically significant increase in the
      number of positive cases in all the Italian regions related to schools
      reopening. Such an increase occurred, in average, about 18.9 days after
      the schools have been reopened. Schools reopening have been significantly
      contributed to the diffusion of the pandemic, with an overall estimated
      impact of about 228,724 positive cases. Conclusions The results suggest
      the need for strict control of all in-school activities. This could be
      done by using, to a variable extent, all the non-pharmaceutical
      interventions available, such as limited access to school spaces, no
      overlapping practices between different sports in the same space,
      universal masking, bubble-size classroom. However, in many cases, such
      measures might not be a viable option, at least in the short run, nor be
      reasonably applicable. Therefore, whenever the established safety criteria
      could not be met, school buildings should remain closed.

      Once more a paper on the effect of school closure aimed at supporting the
      strong belief that schools are one of the major causes of the CoViD-19
      epidemic, trying to prove hypotheses that are set post hoc in a framework
      where the very concept of hypothesis testing is meaningless.


      The way how inferential statistics is used is embarrassing; the misuse of the word "significant" while no null hypothesis is predefined (nor could be), and, if any were implicit, it would be adapted to the situation post hoc (the parameter k is selected to maximize Student's t).


      Causality is inferred, while just coincidence is measured, without any consideration for other possible concomitant events. E.g.: The national referendum involving 25 millions of voters on September 20-21, would prove a better predictor of the increase of the epidemic curve using exactly the same method.


      Wording like "The estimated overall impact of schools reopening is quantified in around 227,724 positives" and the header "school related positives" without the benefit of doubt is not a scientifically sound way to approach the issue; statements of this kind should not be accepted by any scientific papers reviewer.


      A more careful analysis of the data looking at the changes the Rt parameter (or growth rate) that is the trigger to any increase in absolute number of infections, would show that in most of the regions the school openings happened after clear signals of trend changes provided by a properly computed Rt.

    title: Predicting the mutational drivers of future SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: SARS-CoV-2 evolution threatens vaccine- and natural infection-derived
      immunity, and the efficacy of therapeutic antibodies. Herein we sought to
      predict Spike amino acid changes that could contribute to future variants
      of concern. We tested the importance of features comprising epidemiology,
      evolution, immunology, and neural network-based protein sequence modeling.
      This resulted in identification of the primary biological drivers of
      SARS-CoV-2 intra-pandemic evolution. We found evidence that resistance to
      population-level host immunity has increasingly shaped SARS-CoV-2
      evolution over time. We identified with high accuracy mutations that will
      spread, at up to four months in advance, across different phases of the
      pandemic. Behavior of the model was consistent with a plausible causal
      structure wherein epidemiological variables integrate the effects of
      diverse and shifting drivers of viral fitness. We applied our model to
      forecast mutations that will spread in the future, and characterize how
      these mutations affect the binding of therapeutic antibodies. These
      findings demonstrate that it is possible to forecast the driver mutations
      that could appear in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. This
      modeling approach may be applied to any pathogen with genomic surveillance
      data, and so may address other rapidly evolving pathogens such as
      influenza, and unknown future pandemic viruses.

    abstract: "Language and music are two human-unique capacities whose relationship
      remains debated. Some argue for overlap in processing mechanisms,
      especially for structure processing, but others fail to find overlap.
      Using fMRI, we examined the responses of language brain regions to diverse
      music stimuli, and also probed the musical abilities of individuals with
      severe aphasia. Across four experiments, we obtained a clear answer: music
      does not recruit nor requires the language system. The language regions'
      responses to music are generally low and never exceed responses elicited
      by non-music auditory conditions, like animal sounds. Further, the
      language regions are not sensitive to music structure: they show low
      responses to both intact and scrambled music, and to melodies with vs.
      without structural violations. Finally, individuals with aphasia who
      cannot judge sentence grammaticality perform well on melody
      well-formedness judgments. Thus the mechanisms that process structure in
      language do not appear to support music processing."

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      well-designed studies showing masks worked didn't convince you before, I
      doubt another one would convince you now.

    title: Analysis of scientific journalism in Nature reveals gender and regional
      disparities in coverage
    category: scientific-communication-and-education
    abstract: "Scientific journalism is a critical way in which the public can
      remain informed and benefit from new scientific findings. Such journalism
      also shapes the public's view of the current state of scientific findings
      and legitimizes experts. Those covering science can only cite and quote a
      limited number of sources. Sources may be identified by the journalist's
      research or by recommendations by other scientists. In both cases, biases
      may influence who is identified and ultimately included as an expert. We
      analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature to quantify
      possible disparities. Our analysis considered three possible sources of
      disparity: gender, name origin, and country affiliation. To explore these
      sources of disparity, we extracted cited authors' names and affiliations,
      as well as extracted names of quoted speakers. While citations and
      quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering
      process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible
      sources. We then used the extracted names to predict gender and name
      origin of the cited authors and speakers. In order to appropriately
      quantify the level of difference, we must identify a suitable reference
      set for comparison. We chose first and last authors within primary
      research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in
      the same time period as our comparator. In our analysis, we found a skew
      towards male quotation in Nature journalism-related articles, but
      quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than
      first and last authorship in academic publishing. Interestingly, we found
      that the gender disparity in quotes was column-dependent, with the
      \"Career Features\" column reaching gender parity. Our name origin
      analysis found a significant over-representation of names with predicted
      Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted
      East Asian origin. This finding was observed both in extracted quotes and
      journal citations, but dampened in citations. Finally, we performed an
      analysis to identify how countries vary in the way that they're described
      in scientific journalism. We focused on two groups of countries: countries
      that are often mentioned in articles, but do not often have affiliated
      authors cited, and countries that have affiliated authors that are often
      cited, but the country is not typically mentioned. We found that the
      articles in which the less cited countries occur tend to have more
      agricultural, extraction-related, and political terms, whereas articles
      including highly cited countries have broader scientific terms. This
      discrepancy indicates a possible lack of regional diversity in the
      reporting of scientific output."

    title: COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is not detected in human milk
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: Several countries have recently approved the use of mRNA vaccines
      against COVID-19 under an emergency use authorization. However, no
      pregnant or lactating individuals were included in the Phase 3 clinical
      trials of these vaccines despite belonging to a group at high risk for
      severe complications of COVID-19 infection. We show here that the mRNA
      from anti-COVID vaccines is not detected in human breast milk samples
      collected 4-48 hours post-vaccine. These results strengthen the
      recommendation of ABM and WHO that lactating individuals who receive the
      anti-COVID-19 mRNA-based vaccine should continue to breastfeed their
      infants uninterrupted.

    raw_message: it is actually very relevant. spike protein is a transmembrane
      protein. a human cell which gets the mRNA vaccine in it starts producing
      the protein and gets killed by the immune system, and fully diggested.
      spike will not float around. the mRNA in lipid particles can float around
      and should be detected using the test they present here, if it goes into
      the breastmilk. but i cannot judge if the timeframe is correct. the mRNA
      vaccines are stable only for 8-10h in a body, some papers say, so i guess
      the timeframe is correct, but i don't understand than why is this paper
      not yet published. i can not getting a vaccine until i am sure that it is
      not going into the milk, and i would love to see what is going on with
      this research.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    raw_message: The study seems to have a fatal flaw, which is that it was based on
      healthcare workers.  Hospitals and other healthcare offices would have
      very strict mask enforcement and many other mitigation measures not found
      outside of healthcare settings.  Therefore, I don't see how one  can
      extrapolate the results to the general population.  In other words, maybe
      it was the mitigation measures and not the vaccine or prior infection that
      was the primary driver in limiting the spread in this particular scenario.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      There is no question that they work. They work to keep much of the virus
      from spreading. Below, I have already listed several of the studies that
      show this -- including a global study with very different results. The WHO
      is also ignoring this study as it calls for mask wearing just this week. 


      Social distancing does not work 100% either. Neither do vaccines. Neither does good ventilation. The better the mask, the better the protection, the longer the social distancing, the better the protection. The better the ventilation or the more the rain and wind gusts, the better the protection. The consistency of taking precautions, the less the spread. If you wear a mask and then go home to a family with members who do not, you're in trouble. If you all wear masks all the time, and then attend a funeral and mask down, the virus has an in and will take it. People die from such carelessness by the hundreds of thousands. 


      The only reason the virus has been spreading, is that people have not been taking precautions. That's pretty much what this study showed, the sabotage and inconsistency prevailed, such that a brainless virus outsmarted humans causing millions to suffer and get all sorts of organ damage, and millions in the world to die. Viruses work. That's what this study showed, nothing else. 


      For the present strain, as need for better masks and not letting guards down is ever more important, a study such as this requires a virologist or epidemiologist on board to guide both how the study is performed, and what the results of the study actually can show -- how the study can help scientists, and beyond that, how the study can inform people while a deadly pandemic is killing them, their friends and relatives. It's not about appealing to people who would rather not wear a mask for whatever uninformed personal or political opinion they have been exposed to -- and that's who is using this study, the otherwsie uninformed. Science is not about news stories. 


      Onefault of this study is too obvious, that the mandates in sister cities, such as Lowell versus the stricter Cambridge Massachusetts with more compliant citizenry, show incredibly different results. Still today, go to Cambridge, which is a denser city with the same population, and you will see far more people masked up than in Lowell, where the rebel factor has been extreme -- and its citizens paid for it, with their organs, and with their lives. We saw all this happen across the country, as communities in the same state stayed in the "red" or dangerous-to-go-out category, long after similar cities with stricter mandates or better compliance, did not. 


      The study fails at the world level, where so many countries stayed far away from the extraordinarily deadly results that the USA got. We are a beacon of Covid-19 swill. Ultimately, in countries where people got together and governing was caring and effective, the pandemic was kept to a minimum. Every US state could have learned from New Zealand. This week, one person with Covid entered Australia, and the effected communities snapped into action, while in the US, we have just by count alone, 4000 cases of vaccinated people having caught contracted the virus, or need I mention the hundreds still dying each day, testament to the irresponsibility of reporting simething like this.


      The study should have been looking for why they got the results they did. What did it really show? What was wrong with the study, as we already know masks work, and whatever was right with the study, what did it really show? Was it the extent to which sabotaging mask-wearing works? Was it that mask wearing was not as consistently performed as it could have been (a no brainer)? In other words, did people find funerals a good place to finally take masks off and spread the virus around? What good was all the hours of mask wearing? I saw couples (plural) under the cover of night, where the man was unmasked and his woman was not. What good was her mask?

    title: Neuromodulation Exerts Feedback and Feedforward Control of Action Selection
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: >-
      To be effective, behavioral choices must result in actions that are
      appropriate to an animal's needs and environmental circumstances. In
      addition, the actions must be ones the animal can sustain until its needs
      are met. This aligning of goals, action, and motivation requires the
      coordinated activity of multiple brain circuits, but how such coordination
      is achieved is poorly understood. Here, we show how the insect hormone
      Bursicon coordinates the selection and sustains execution of a behavior in
      newly emerged adult Drosophila. Such flies must expand and harden their
      wings after metamorphosis, but they choose to delay expansion in confined
      conditions. We show that the decision to expand is mediated by an
      environmentally-sensitive, positive feedback loop in which Bursicon
      promotes its own sustained release. Released Bursicon then modulates motor
      neurons to promote wing expansion behavior. Bursicon thus exerts
      feedforward and feedback control to coordinately select and motivate a
      goal-directed action.

    title: Dynamic rewiring of biological activity across genotype and lineage
      revealed by context-dependent functional interactions
    category: systems-biology
    abstract: Coessentiality networks derived from CRISPR screens in cell lines
      provide a powerful framework for identifying functional modules in the
      cell and for inferring the role of uncharacterized genes. However, these
      networks integrate signal across all underlying data, and can mask strong
      interactions that occur in only a subset of the cell lines analyzed. Here
      we decipher dynamic functional interactions by identifying significant
      cellular contexts, primarily by oncogenic mutation, lineage, and tumor
      type, and discovering coessentiality relationships that depend on these
      contexts. We recapitulate well-known gene-context interactions such as
      oncogene-mutation, paralog buffering, and tissue-specific essential genes,
      show how mutation rewires known signal transduction pathways, including
      RAS/RAF and IGF1R-PIK3CA, and illustrate the implications for drug
      targeting. We further demonstrate how context-dependent functional
      interactions can elucidate lineage-specific gene function, as illustrated
      by the maturation of proreceptors IGF1R and MET by proteases FURIN and
      CPD. This approach advances our understanding of context-dependent
      interactions and how they can be gleaned from these data.

    abstract: Visual image reconstruction from brain activity produces images whose
      features are consistent with the neural representations in the visual
      cortex given arbitrary visual instances [1-3], presumably reflecting the
      persons visual experience. Previous reconstruction studies have been
      concerned either with how stimulus images are faithfully reconstructed or
      with whether mentally imagined contents can be reconstructed in the
      absence of external stimuli. However, many lines of vision research have
      demonstrated that even stimulus perception is shaped both by
      stimulus-induced processes and top-down processes. In particular,
      attention (or the lack of it) is known to profoundly affect visual
      experience [4-8] and brain activity [9-21]. Here, to investigate how
      top-down attention impacts the neural representation of visual images and
      the reconstructions, we use a state-of-the-art method (deep image
      reconstruction [3]) to reconstruct visual images from fMRI activity
      measured while subjects attend to one of two images superimposed with
      equally weighted contrasts. Deep image reconstruction exploits the
      hierarchical correspondence between the brain and a deep neural network
      (DNN) to translate (decode) brain activity into DNN features of multiple
      layers, and then create images that are consistent with the decoded DNN
      features [3, 22, 23]. Using the deep image reconstruction model trained on
      fMRI responses to single natural images, we decode brain activity during
      the attention trials. Behavioral evaluations show that the reconstructions
      resemble the attended rather than the unattended images. The
      reconstructions can be modeled by superimposed images with contrasts
      biased to the attended one, which are comparable to the appearance of the
      stimuli under attention measured in a separate session. Attentional
      modulations are found in a broad range of hierarchical visual
      representations and mirror the brain-DNN correspondence. Our results
      demonstrate that top-down attention counters stimulus-induced responses
      and modulate neural representations to render reconstructions in
      accordance with subjective appearance. The reconstructions appear to
      reflect the content of visual experience and volitional control, opening a
      new possibility of brain-based communication and creation.

    title: "The Clade Displacement Index: how to detect hotizontal gene transfers in
      unrooted gene trees"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: "While most genes of any organism are inherited vertically - i.e. from
      its parent organisms - sometimes they can be exchanged between unrelated
      species in a process known as the horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Studies
      of HGT contribute to our knowledge about the mechanisms of evolution,
      including the emergence of new pathogens, and a great deal of effort has
      been put into different methods of finding transferred genes. The golden
      standard of HGT detection is the analysis of the incongruence between the
      gene and the species trees. Those methods typically require rooted trees,
      in which the direction of evolution is known. Gene trees are typically
      unrooted, and rooting them is yet another step in HGT analysis, prone to
      errors which may lead to wrong conclusions. A natural question arises: can
      HGTs be detected in gene trees without rooting them at all? It turns out
      that, for a particular, yet broad, class of transfers, the answer to this
      question is: yes. It also turns out that the same methodology can be
      applied to complement the bootstrap support in assessing the stability of
      gene tree topology. In this article, we present the Clade Displacement
      Index, a measure of shift of a given clade's location between two trees.
      We derive algorithms to compute it and give several examples of its
      applications to HGT detection and gene tree stability analysis. We finish
      by pointing out directions for further studies and an example that shows
      that not all HGTs are detectable without knowing the location of the root
      of the gene tree. A Jupyter Notebook with the implementation and
      applications of CDI described in this paper is available at
      \\url{https://github.com/mciach/CDI}"

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: The Connexin 43 Carboxyl Terminal Mimetic Peptide alphaCT1 Prompts
      Differentiation of a Collagen Scar Matrix Resembling Unwounded Skin
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: >-
      Phase II clinical trials have reported that acute treatment of surgical
      skin wounds with the therapeutic peptide alphaCT1 improves cutaneous scar
      appearance by 47% 9-months post-surgery - though mode-of-action remains
      unknown. Scar matrix structure in biopsies 2 to 6 weeks post-wounding
      treated topically with alphaCT1 or control treatments from human subjects,
      Sprague-Dawley rats, and IAF hairless guinea pigs were compared. The sole
      effect on scar structure was that alphaCT1-treated scars had less
      alignment of collagen fibers relative to control wounds, a state that
      resembles unwounded skin. This more random alignment was recapitulated in
      both animal models, together with transient increases in collagen density,
      although the guinea pig was found to more closely replicate the pattern of
      response to alphaCT1 in human scars, compared to rat. Fibroblasts treated
      with alphaCT1 in vitro showed decreased directionality and an agent-based
      computational model parameterized with fibroblast motility data predicted
      collagen alignments in simulated scars consistent with that observed
      experimentally in human and the animal models. In conclusion, alphaCT1
      prompts decreased directionality of fibroblast movement and the generation
      of a 3D collagen matrix post-wounding that is similar to unwounded skin -
      changes that correlate with long-term improvement in scar appearance.

    title: Rapid displacement of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 by B.1.617.2 and P.1 in
      the United States
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.617.2 displaced B.1.1.7 as the
      dominant variant in England and other countries. This study aimed to
      determine whether B.1.617.2 was also displacing B.1.1.7 in the United
      States. We analyzed PCR testing results and viral sequencing results of
      samples collected across the United States, and showed that B.1.1.7 was
      rapidly being displaced and is no longer responsible for the majority of
      new cases. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases that are B.1.1.7
      dropped from 70% in April 2021 to 42% in just 6 weeks. Our analysis showed
      rapid growth of variants B.1.617.2 and P.1 as the primary drivers for this
      displacement. Currently, the growth rate of B.1.617.2 was higher than P.1
      in the US (0.61 vs. 0.22), which is consistent with reports from other
      countries. Lastly, we showed that B.1.617.2 was growing faster in counties
      with a lower vaccination rate.

      respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a comparative analysis of
      SARS-CoV-2 proteome has been performed in two phases by considering
      manually curated 31389 whole genome sequences from 84 countries. Among the
      9 mutations that occur at a high significance (T85I-NPS2, L37F-NSP6,
      P323L-NSP12, D614G-spike, Q57H-ORF3a, G251V-ORF3a, L84S-ORF8,
      R203K-nucleocapsid and G204R-nucleocapsid), R203K-nucleocapsid and
      G204R-nucleocapsid are co-occurring (dependent) mutations and P323L-NSP12
      and D614G-spike often appear simultaneously. Other notable variations that
      appear with a moderate to low significance are, M85-NSP1 deletion,
      D268-NSP2 deletion, 112 amino acids deletion in ORF8, a phenylalanine
      insertion amidst F34-F36 (NSP6) and several co-existing (dependent)
      substitution/deletion (I559V & P585S in NSP2, P504L & Y541C in NSP13, G82
      & H83 deletions in NSP1 and K141, S142 & F143 deletions in NSP2)
      mutations. P323L-NSP12, D614G-spike, L37F-NSP6, L84S-ORF8 and the
      sequences deficient of the high significant mutations have led to 4 major
      SARS-CoV-2 clades. The top 5 countries bearing all the high significant
      and majority of the moderate significant mutations are: USA, England,
      Wales, Australia and Scotland. Further, the majority of the significant
      mutations have evolved in the first phase and have already transmitted
      around the globe indicating the positive selection pressure. Among the 26
      SARS-CoV-2 proteins, nucleocapsid protein, ORF3a, ORF8, RNA dependent RNA
      polymerase and spike exhibit a higher heterogeneity compared with the rest
      of the proteins. However, NSP9, NSP10, NSP8, the envelope protein and NSP4
      are highly resistant to mutations and can be exploited for drug/vaccine
      development.

    title: Systematic single-variant and gene-based association testing of 3,700
      phenotypes in 281,850 UK Biobank exomes
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: Genome-wide association studies have successfully discovered thousands
      of common variants associated with human diseases and traits, but the
      landscape of rare variation in human disease has not been explored at
      scale. Exome sequencing studies of population biobanks provide an
      opportunity to systematically evaluate the impact of rare coding variation
      across a wide range of phenotypes to discover genes and allelic series
      relevant to human health and disease. Here, we present results from
      systematic association analyses of 3,700 phenotypes using single-variant
      and gene tests of 281,850 individuals in the UK Biobank with exome
      sequence data. We find that the discovery of genetic associations is
      tightly linked to frequency as well as correlated with metrics of
      deleteriousness and natural selection. We highlight biological findings
      elucidated by these data and release the dataset as a public resource
      alongside a browser framework for rapidly exploring rare variant
      association results.

      Really cool! 


      Why do we get different numbers of results for different genes? If I type in a gene symbol into the browser and then press "export data to csv" - I get different numbers of rows for different genes:


      APOE:   1001 phenotypes

      PCSK9: 1951 phenotypes

      BRCA1: 1950 phenotypes

      IL6:          978 phenotypes


      At first we thought it might be a pvalue threshold but there are entries with pvalue=1 in all cases...

    title: Determination of clinical risk factors associated with inflammation in
      hypertensive patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Obesity and chronic diseases associated with the
      development of inflammation have remained unclear if the observed
      inflammatory state in diabetic patients is due to excess adipose tissue
      mass and/or directly associated with the diabetic state. Therefore, this
      study determined the risk factors associated with inflammation in
      hypertensive patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A total of
      164 hypertensive diabetic patients aged 38 to 60 years were selected from
      seven primary health care centers in Gaza city, Palestine. Interview and
      questionnaire were employed to collect data related to age, gender,
      smoking habits, and physical activity pattern. Besides, the selection of
      patients depended on objective criteria. Results: The study involved 118
      (72%) women and 46 (28%) men. The mean of age for all patients was 53.7 ±
      0.46 years old. 76 patients (46.3%) were categorized as current smokers,
      88 patients (53.7%) categorized as non-smokers. The baseline distribution
      of patients according to physical activity has displayed that 130 (79.3%)
      were low physically active patients, 28 (27.1%) were moderate, and 6
      (3.7%) were highly physically active patients. A tertile of inflammation
      feature with high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was developed.
      The highest tertile of hs-CRP was significantly associated with women,
      higher obesity indices, metabolic dysregulation involving lipid profile
      markers, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood pressure, higher
      interleukin 6 (IL-6), and lower adiponectin. Via ordinal logistic
      regression analysis, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking habits, and
      physical activity; the risk factors for hs-CRP were the increased body
      mass index [OR: 1.17, P=0.018], IL-6 [OR: 2.22, P=0.025] and FBG [OR:
      1.01, P=0.007], as well as reduced adiponectin [OR: 0.81, P=0.002].
      Conclusion: The inflammation state was affected by obesity and had been
      related to altered adipokines levels of IL-6 and adiponectin, as well as
      affected by the disease condition of diabetes, as evidenced by higher
      serum level of FBG."

    title: A novel flight style allowing the smallest featherwing beetles to excel

    abstract: Flight speed generally correlates positively with animal body size
      [1]. Surprisingly, miniature featherwing beetles can fly at speeds and
      accelerations of insects three times as large [2]. We show here that this
      performance results from a previously unknown type of wing motion. Our
      experiment combines three-dimensional reconstructions of morphology and
      kinematics in one of the smallest insects, Paratuposa placentis (body
      length 395 m). The flapping bristled wing follows a pronounced
      figure-eight loop that consists of subperpendicular up and down strokes
      followed by claps at stroke reversals, above and below the body.
      Computational analyses suggest a functional decomposition of the flapping
      cycle in two power half strokes producing a large upward force and two
      down-dragging recovery half strokes. In contrast to heavier membranous
      wings, the motion of bristled wings of the same size requires little
      inertial power. Muscle mechanical power requirements thus remain positive
      throughout the wing beat cycle, making elastic energy storage obsolete.
      This novel flight style evolved during miniaturization may compensate for
      costs associated with air viscosity and helps explain how extremely small
      insects preserved superb aerial performance during miniaturization.
      Incorporating this flight style in artificial flappers is a challenge for
      designers of micro aerial vehicles.

      ObjectiveThe human brain is influenced by different biological rhythms,
      including the daily 24-hour (diurnal) cycle. Past studies have reported
      evidence of variation in cognitive performance over the course of the day,
      and of differences in the peak time for cognition in older age. Here, we
      investigated these questions using two existing longitudinal studies of
      healthy adults.


      MethodsTime of neuropsychological battery testing was extracted from study records, and we analyzed cognitive performance measures from 4 domains (Vocabulary, Processing Speed, Fluid Reasoning, and Episodic Memory) in 543 healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 80. Time of day was dichotomized as morning (281 tested before noon), and afternoon (242 tested after noon).


      ResultsMultivariate analyses controlling for both gender and years of education revealed no significant effect of time of testing (or its interaction with participant age) on cognitive performance. These results suggest that diurnal effects during time periods typically used to test human subjects are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on performance on the neuropsychological tests that are used for standard cognitive assessment.


      ConclusionThis suggests that the effect of time of day on cognition in the context of aging may not be as ubiquitous as previously suggested, and thus is unlikely to represent a large confound in existing studies of cognition across the adult lifespan.

    raw_message: Interesting paper, but I think given the lack of information about
      chronotype/circadian rhythms & the lack of control of when people came in
      means I’m not sure I buy that this says much about time of day - just that
      people generally circumvent detrimental outcomes to cognition by planning
      to come in for experiments when they feel awake and ready to be tested.
      I’d love to see a study using actigraphy x time of testing effects on
      cognition at the same sort of scale as this study.

    title: "APPLAUSE: Automatic Prediction of PLAcental health via U-net
      Segmentation and statistical Evaluation"
    category: obstetrics-and-gynecology
    abstract: "Purpose: Artificial-intelligence population-based automated
      quantification of placental maturation and health from a rapid functional
      Magnetic Resonance scan. The placenta plays a crucial role for any
      successful human pregnancy. Deviations from the normal dynamic maturation
      throughout gestation are closely linked to major pregnancy complications.
      Antenatal assessment in-vivo using T2* relaxometry has shown great promise
      to inform management and possible interventions but clinical translation
      is hampered by time consuming manual segmentation and analysis techniques
      based on comparison against normative curves over gestation. Methods: This
      study proposes a fully automatic pipeline to predict the biological age
      and health of the placenta based on a rapid (sub-30 second) T2* scan in
      two steps: Automatic segmentation using a U-Net and a Gaussian Process
      regression model to characterize placental maturation and health. These
      are trained and evaluated on 110 3T MRI placental data sets including 20
      high-risk pregnancies diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and/or fetal growth
      restriction. Results: Automatic segmentation achieves comparable
      performance to human experts (mean DICE coefficients automatic-manual
      0.76, Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.986 for mean T2* within the
      masks). The placental health prediction achieves an excellent ability to
      differentiate early cases of placental insufficiency before 32 weeks. High
      abnormality scores correlate with low birth weight, premature birth and
      histopathological findings. Retrospective application on a different
      cohort imaged at 1.5T illustrates the ability for direct clinical
      translation. Conclusion: The presented automatic pipeline facilitates a
      fast, robust and reliable prediction of placental maturation. It yields
      human-interpretable and verifiable intermediate results and quantifies
      uncertainties on the cohort-level and for individual predictions. The
      proposed machine-learning pipeline runs in close to real-time and,
      deployed in clinical settings, has the potential to become a cornerstone
      of diagnosis and intervention of placental insufficiency."

    title: Recovery of deleted deep sequencing data sheds more light on the early
      Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains shrouded in mystery.
      Here I identify a data set containing SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in
      the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH's Sequence Read
      Archive. I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud, and
      reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic
      analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing
      data further supports the idea that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences
      are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the
      epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of currently known SARS-CoV-2 sequences
      likely contained three mutations relative to the market viruses that made
      it more similar to SARS-CoV-2's bat coronavirus relatives.

      Thanks for the comments. I fully agree that there is relatively little
      phylogenetic signal among early SARS-CoV-2 sequences, but this is an
      unavoidable aspect of working with viral outbreak sequences that are all
      closely related. Because the sequences all differ by just a few mutations,
      there is never extremely strong phylogenetic support for any scenario, but
      it is still possible to make informative analyses.


      Furthermore, it is not true that there is no phylogenetic signal for rooting the tree. As discussed by Pipes and Nielsen (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/4/1537/6028993), outgroup rooting methods do lead to consistent placement of the root in clade A. The problem is that this root placement is statistically incompatible with the date-based root placements (again, see Pipes and Nielsen). The current study suggests an explanation for this inconsistency: possible biases in which early sequences are known. It also suggests the presence in clade A of an additional mutation towards the outgroup (T29095C) that further strengthens the idea that clade A may be the more ancestral one by providing a second scenario that moves some viruses in clade A three steps closer to the outgroup (the other scenario is proCoV2 by Kumar, Pond, et al https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135569/ who also explain difficulties in rooting using just traditional phylogenetic approaches).


      Also, see the discussion in the 2nd and 3rd to last paragraphs of the Discussion section of the pre-print. I explicitly explain (2nd to last) why I am presenting qualitative / visual conclusions rather than formal phylogenetic statistical hypothesis testing. I think we need to recognize that for outbreak sequences that are closely related (as you point out), the questions are not going to be fully resolved just by using advanced statistical phylogenetic algorithms, and we need to also maximize information from metadata about the sequences (such as I do in the pre-print for the four Guangdong sequences) and also pay attention to any information that suggests the extent to which available sequences may or may not be fully representative of circulating viruses.

    title: Optimal Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Philippines
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Vaccine allocation is a national concern especially for countries such
      as the Philippines that have limited resources in acquiring COVID-19
      vaccines. As such, certain groups are suggested to be prioritized for
      vaccination to protect the most vulnerable before vaccinating others. Our
      model suggests an allocation of vaccines such that COVID-19 deaths are
      minimized while the prioritization framework is satisfied. Results of the
      model show that a vaccine coverage of at least 50 to 70% of the population
      can be enough for a community with limited supplies, and an increase in
      vaccine supply is beneficial if initial coverage is less than the
      specified target range. Also, among the vaccines considered in the study,
      the one with 89.9% effectiveness and has a 183 Philippine peso (Php) price
      per dose projected the least number of deaths. Compared to other model
      variations and common allocation approaches, the model has achieved both
      an optimal and equitable allocation. This will be helpful for policymakers
      in determining a vaccine distribution for a resource-constrained
      community.

    title: Investigating the reliability of molecular estimates of evolutionary time
      when substitution rates and speciation rates vary
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Background An accurate timescale of evolutionary history is essential
      to testing hypotheses about the influence of historical events and
      processes, and the timescale for evolution is increasingly derived from
      analysis of DNA sequences. But variation in the rate of molecular
      evolution complicates the inference of time from DNA. Evidence is growing
      for numerous factors, such as life history and habitat, that are linked
      both to the molecular processes of mutation and fixation and to rates of
      macroevolutionary diversification. However, the most widely used models of
      molecular rate variation, such as the uncorrelated and autocorrelated
      lognormal clocks, rely on idealised models of rate variation and molecular
      dating methods are rarely tested against complex models of rate change.
      One relationship that is not accounted for in molecular dating is the
      potential for interaction between molecular substitution rates and
      speciation, a relationship that has been supported by empirical studies in
      a growing number of taxa. If these relationships are as widespread as
      evidence indicates, they may have a significant influence on molecular
      dates. Results We simulate phylogenies and molecular sequences under three
      different realistic rate variation models - one in which speciation rates
      and substitution rates both vary but are unlinked, one in which they
      covary continuously and one punctuated model in which molecular change is
      concentrated in speciation events, using empirical case studies to
      parameterise realistic simulations. We test two commonly used "relaxed
      clock" molecular dating methods against these realistic simulations to
      explore the degree of error in molecular dates under each model. We find
      average divergence time inference errors ranging from 12% of node age for
      the unlinked model when reconstructed under an uncorrelated rate prior, to
      up to 93% when punctuated simulations are reconstructed under an
      autocorrelated prior. Conclusions We demonstrate the potential for
      substantial errors in molecular dates when both speciation rates and
      substitution rates vary between lineages. This study highlights the need
      for tests of molecular dating methods against realistic models of rate
      variation generated from empirical parameters and known relationships.

      This is an interesting study; I'm always encouraged to see careful
      examinations of different phylogenetic approaches.  As with similar
      simulation studies, I might be inclined to question would be whether the
      Robinson–Foulds distance is the most appropriate here: trees with an RF
      distance of 5 might in fact be more different than trees 

      with an RF distance of 6, depending on whether the five or six unshared clades are major or minor groupings. I've reviewed this problem more fully at https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa614 (Smith 2020, Bioinformatics). Apologies if I missed it, but I didn't see whether the reconstructed trees were fully bifurcating; if they contained polytomies, then you might also want to consider whether the improved accuracy of some methods came at the expense of precision (see Smith 2019, Biology Letters, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2018.0632 ).

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the

      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected

      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected

      It is reassuring to some, but borderline insanity to others that we have
      to prove we have an immune system.  We knew early in 2020, that prior T
      cell immunity was present in probably 50%+ of the population, from prior
      coronaviruses from as far back as 15y (or longer).  




      Covid likely is a patient-specific immune hypersensitivity. Some say MCAS, it may turn out to be.  If that is the case, vaccines or not, those patients need drugs -- which implies drug therapies are the only way out.


      And yet, the conclusion to this piece is about prioritizing vaccines.  Scientists take a look at data from nation states like Mexico. Not small trials, massive interventions at scale.  Or India.  You are making a blunder which will meme''d about till the end of time.  See our twitter on how to save your reputations.

    title: Addressing anti-syncytin antibody levels, and fertility and breastfeeding
      concerns, following BNT162B2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccination
    category: obstetrics-and-gynecology
    abstract: "Objective: To determine whether antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2
      spike protein following BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 mRNA
      vaccination cross-react with human syncytin-1 protein, and if BNT162B2
      mRNA enters breast milk. Methods: In this observational cohort study of
      female front-line workers with no history of COVID-19 infection, we
      amplified BNT162B2 mRNA in plasma and breast milk and assayed
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and anti-human syncytin-1 binding
      antibodies in plasma, at early (1-4 days) and late (4-7 weeks) time points
      following first-dose vaccination. Results: Fifteen consented participants
      (mean age 40.4 years, various ethnicities) who received at least one dose
      of BNT162B2, including five breast-feeding women and two women who were
      inadvertently vaccinated in early pregnancy, were recruited. BNT162B2
      mRNA, detected by amplifying part of the spike-encoding region, was
      detected in plasma 1-4 days following the first dose (n=13), but not 4-5
      weeks later (n=2), nor was the mRNA isolated from aqueous or lipid breast
      milk fractions collected 0-7 days post-vaccination (n=5). Vaccine
      recipients demonstrated strong SARS-CoV-2 neutralising activity by at
      least four weeks after the first dose (n=15), including the two pregnant
      women. None had placental anti-syncytin-1 binding antibodies at either
      time-point following vaccination. Conclusions: BNT162B2-vaccinated women
      did not transmit vaccine mRNA to breast milk, and did not produce a
      concurrent humoral response to syncytin-1, suggesting that
      cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 on the developing trophoblast, or other
      adverse effects in the breast-fed infant from vaccine mRNA ingestion, are
      unlikely."

    title: Impact estimation on COVID-19 infections following school reopening in
      September 2020 in Italy
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Background Since its outbreak, CoViD-19 (formally known as 2019-nCoV)
      has been triggering many questions among public authorities, social
      organisms and school officials, as to when students should be allowed to
      return to school. Such a decision is critical and must take into account,
      other than its beneficial effects, also those associated with an increased
      exposition of the students to the virus, which, as a result, might spread
      at a faster rate. To date, in Italy, a few studies have rigorously
      investigated the correlation between school reopening and number of people
      tested positive to CoViD-19. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an
      assessment of such an impact as well as to illustrate the methodology
      followed. Methods Official daily data on the cumulative number of people
      tested positive to CoViD-19, in conjunction with external information
      accounting for the different points in time schools reopened in the
      various Italian regions, have been employed to build a stochastic model of
      the type Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average embodying external
      information. Results There was a statistically significant increase in the
      number of positive cases in all the Italian regions related to schools
      reopening. Such an increase occurred, in average, about 18.9 days after
      the schools have been reopened. Schools reopening have been significantly
      contributed to the diffusion of the pandemic, with an overall estimated
      impact of about 228,724 positive cases. Conclusions The results suggest
      the need for strict control of all in-school activities. This could be
      done by using, to a variable extent, all the non-pharmaceutical
      interventions available, such as limited access to school spaces, no
      overlapping practices between different sports in the same space,
      universal masking, bubble-size classroom. However, in many cases, such
      measures might not be a viable option, at least in the short run, nor be
      reasonably applicable. Therefore, whenever the established safety criteria
      could not be met, school buildings should remain closed.

    raw_message: "This comment seems more the result of the desire to find errors at
      all costs, in a pre-print whose authors criticizes for method and
      reliability a paper by Rainsio that comes to opposite conclusions. What is
      really embarrassing is not the use of inferential statistics by Fienga and
      Galli, but the criticisms of Rainisio that confuses the null hypothesis
      with the alternative: a null hypothesis can always be formulated, both for
      controlled and retrospective studies.  In a time series for example a null
      hypothesis is the absence of a trend. Curiously Rainisio also seems not to
      notice that arguing that a value of Rt has not been observed in relation
      to the opening-closing of schools (as Rainisio and colleagues did in their
      paper cited by Fienga) is equivalent to accepting the null hypothesis of
      no-change over time, even in the absence of a formal test and a p-value.
      Consistently, Rainisio's comment closes with a gloss and demonstration of
      what a null-hypothesis is."

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

    title: "Breadth of neutralising antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants of
      concern is augmented by vaccination following prior infection: studies in
      UK healthcare workers and immunodeficient patients"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: A large portion of the UK general population has currently only
      received a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccination (either BNT162b2 (Pfizer)
      or AZD1222 (Vaxevria, AstraZeneca)), making it critical that we continue
      to track and understand the levels of protection against SARS-CoV-2
      Variants of Concern (VOCs). We undertook a single-centre cross-sectional
      study in order to understand the variations in vaccine-induced immunity to
      the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine strain (B.1) and three major VOCs (B.1.1.7, B.1351
      and P.1). We studied a cohort of outpatients with immunodeficiencies
      (IDPs) and health care workers (HCWs) based at the same critical care
      tertiary NHS Trust, following a single dose of either BNT162b2 or AZD1222
      vaccines. Our serological data revealed either undetectable antibodies or
      low neutralising antibodies (nAbs) in IDPs, with only 5% and 3% showing
      detectable neutralisation of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, respectively. Healthy
      HCWs without a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrated a wide range of nAb
      titres post-vaccination. However, their responses are significantly lower
      than HCWs with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neutralisation of VOCs with
      the E484K mutation (B.1.351 and P.1) were consistently lower in HCWs in
      the absence of evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (p<0.001). Notably,
      in HCWs with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is a significant increase
      of neutralising titres post-vaccination to all four strains, compared to
      their pre-vaccination neutralisation titres. This underscores the
      importance of vaccination even in populations that have been previously
      exposed, and also provides support for the hypothesis that a second-dose
      of vaccination will similarly boost immunity to greater protective levels
      in individuals without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Overall, this
      serological nAb analysis after a single-dose of BNT162b2 or AZD1222
      vaccination demonstrates a wide variety of responses, particularly against
      the VOCs, and suggests limited neutralisation-based protection in
      individuals with immunodeficiencies.

    title: Perceptions of immunity and vaccination certificates among the general
      population of Geneva, Switzerland.
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: As of June 2021, the European Union (EU) and Switzerland have
      published information about the introduction of COVID certificates in
      order to facilitate the safe free movement of their citizens. With
      implementation underway, little is known about the public perception of
      such certificates with potential differences in acceptability among
      individuals. In March 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was
      proposed to all individuals 18 years and older participating in the
      longitudinal follow-up of population-based seroprevalence studies in
      Geneva, Switzerland. The questionnaire covered aspects of individual and
      collective benefits, while allowing participants to select contexts in
      which vaccination certificates should be presented. Results were presented
      as the proportion of individuals agreeing or disagreeing with the
      implementation of vaccination certificates, selecting specific contexts
      where certificates should be presented, and agreeing or disagreeing with
      the potential risks related to certificates. Logistic regression was used
      to calculate odds ratios for factors associated with certificate
      non-acceptance. Overall, 4,056 individuals completed the questionnaire
      (response rate 77.6%; mean age 53.3, standard deviation 14.4 years; 56.1%
      were women). About 61.0% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that a
      vaccination certificate was necessary in certain contexts; and 21.6%
      believed there was no context where vaccination certificates should be
      presented. Contexts where a majority of participants perceived a
      vaccination certificate should be presented included jobs where others
      would be at risk of COVID-related complications (60.7%), jobs where
      employees would be at risk of getting infected (58.7%), or to be exempt
      from quarantine when traveling abroad (56.1%). Contexts where fewer
      individuals perceived the need for vaccination certificates to be
      presented were participation in large gatherings (36.9%), access to social
      venues (35.5%), or sharing the same workspace (21.5%). Younger age, an
      absence of willingness to get vaccinated, and an absence of belief in
      vaccination as an important step in surmounting the pandemic were factors
      associated with certificate non-acceptance. This large population-based
      study showed that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland,
      agreed with the implementation of vaccination certificates in work-related
      and travel-related contexts. However, this solution was perceived as
      unnecessary for access to large gatherings or social venues, or to share
      the same workspace. Differences were seen with gender, age, education,
      socio-economic status, and vaccination willingness and perception,
      highlighting the importance of taking personal and sociodemographic
      variations into consideration when predicting acceptance of such
      certificates.

      Very interesting study. 


      One thing that must be considered is whether passports/certificates will push groups in high outbreak probability regions further away from vaccinating. That seems to be the case for the UK: see below for a study I recently conducted in the UK.

    title: "The Clade Displacement Index: how to detect horizontal gene transfers in
      unrooted gene trees"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: >-
      While most genes of any organism are inherited vertically - i.e. from its
      parent organisms - sometimes they can be exchanged between unrelated
      species in a process known as the horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Studies
      of HGT contribute to our knowledge about the mechanisms of evolution,
      including the emergence of new pathogens, and a great deal of effort has
      been put into different methods of finding transferred genes. The golden
      standard of HGT detection is the analysis of the incongruence between the
      gene and the species trees. Those methods typically require rooted trees,
      in which the direction of evolution is known. Gene trees are typically
      unrooted, and rooting them is yet another step in HGT analysis, prone to
      errors which may lead to wrong conclusions. A natural question arises: can
      HGTs be detected in gene trees without rooting them at all?


      It turns out that, for a particular, yet broad, class of transfers, the answer to this question is: yes. It also turns out that the same methodology can be applied to complement the bootstrap support in assessing the stability of gene tree topology. In this article, we present the Clade Displacement Index, a measure of shift of a given clades location between two trees. We derive algorithms to compute it and give several examples of its applications to HGT detection and gene tree stability analysis. We finish by pointing out directions for further studies and an example that shows that not all HGTs are detectable without knowing the location of the root of the gene tree.

      Thanks! I haven't tried to use information-based approaches. I've analyzed
      the properties of correlation between splits, though (actually, between
      the weights of labels, because I'm dealing with repeating labels; the
      weights are defined roughly as the probability that a leaf with a given
      label is in the first component of the split). Correlation didn't work
      well in this context, because it was very sensitive in the case when one
      of the splits is trivial, and difficult to compute for non-binary trees.
      That was the reason to choose the absolute difference between label
      weights, and it  worked quite well, so I didn't check other approaches. It
      may be worth it, though :) 




      Thanks for the link to your paper. I've actually been looking for alternative metrics of tree similarity recently, so it may turn out be quite useful :)

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

    abstract: "Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are based on a range of novel vaccine
      platforms, with adenovirus-based approaches (like ChAdOx1 nCov-19) being
      one of them. Recently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted
      adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome
      (TTS). TTS is characterized by low platelet counts, clot formation at
      unusual anatomic sites and platelet-activating PF4-polyanion antibodies
      reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we employ in vitro
      and in vivo models to characterize the possible mechanisms of this
      platelet-targeted autoimmunity. We show that intravenous but not
      intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus
      aggregate formation and platelet activation. After intravenous injection,
      these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and
      platelet remnants are found in the marginal zone and follicles. This is
      followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating
      antibodies binding to platelets. Our work contributes to the understanding
      of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential
      mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. Hence, safe intramuscular injection,
      with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive
      measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines."

    title: Discrete immune response signature to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination versus
      infection
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination elicit potent immune
      responses. A number of studies have described immune responses to
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, beyond antibody production, immune
      responses to COVID-19 vaccines remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we
      performed multimodal single-cell sequencing on peripheral blood of
      patients with acute COVID- 19 and healthy volunteers before and after
      receiving the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to compare the immune
      responses elicited by the virus and by this vaccine. Phenotypic and
      transcriptional profiling of immune cells, coupled with reconstruction of
      the B and T cell antigen receptor rearrangement of individual lymphocytes,
      enabled us to characterize and compare the host responses to the virus and
      to defined viral antigens. While both infection and vaccination induced
      robust innate and adaptive immune responses, our analysis revealed
      significant qualitative differences between the two types of immune
      challenges. In COVID-19 patients, immune responses were characterized by a
      highly augmented interferon response which was largely absent in vaccine
      recipients. Increased interferon signaling likely contributed to the
      observed dramatic upregulation of cytotoxic genes in the peripheral T
      cells and innate-like lymphocytes in patients but not in immunized
      subjects. Analysis of B and T cell receptor repertoires revealed that
      while the majority of clonal B and T cells in COVID-19 patients were
      effector cells, in vaccine recipients clonally expanded cells were
      primarily circulating memory cells. Importantly, the divergence in immune
      subsets engaged, the transcriptional differences in key immune
      populations, and the differences in maturation of adaptive immune cells
      revealed by our analysis have far-ranging implications for immunity to
      this novel pathogen.

    title: GABA administration limits viral replication and pneumonitis in a mouse
      model of COVID-19
    category: immunology
    abstract: Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and
      death induced by coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden
      because of vaccination hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the
      appearance of novel coronaviruses. Accordingly, there is a need for new
      approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections.
      Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA
      (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists
      have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We
      previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity
      and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1)
      which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report
      that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that
      GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus
      replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment
      reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for
      human consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising
      candidate to help treat COVID-19.

    title: Genomic characterization of metastatic patterns from prospective clinical
      sequencing of 25,000 patients
    category: cancer-biology
    abstract: Progression to metastatic disease remains the main cause of cancer
      death. Yet, the underlying genomic mechanisms driving metastasis remain
      largely unknown. Here, we present MSK-MET, an integrated pan-cancer cohort
      of tumor genomic and clinical outcome data from more than 25,000 patients.
      We analyzed this dataset to identify associations between tumor genomic
      alterations and patterns of metastatic dissemination across 50 tumor
      types. We found that chromosomal instability is strongly correlated with
      metastatic burden in some tumor types, including prostate adenocarcinoma,
      lung adenocarcinoma and HR-positive breast ductal carcinoma, but not in
      others, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer. We also identified specific somatic
      alterations associated with increased metastatic burden and specific
      routes of metastatic spread. Our data offer a unique resource for the
      investigation of the biological basis for metastatic spread and highlight
      the crucial role of chromosomal instability in cancer progression.

    title: GABA administration limits viral replication and pneumonitis in a mouse
      model of COVID-19
    category: immunology
    abstract: Despite the availability of vaccines for COVID-19, serious illness and
      death induced by coronavirus infection will remain a global health burden
      because of vaccination hesitancy, possible virus mutations, and the
      appearance of novel coronaviruses. Accordingly, there is a need for new
      approaches to limit severe illness stemming from coronavirus infections.
      Cells of the immune system and lung epithelia express receptors for GABA
      (GABA-Rs), a widely used neurotransmitter within the CNS. GABA-R agonists
      have anti-inflammatory effects and can limit acute lung injury. We
      previously showed that GABA treatment effectively reduced disease severity
      and death rates in mice following infection with a coronavirus (MHV-1)
      which provides a potentially lethal model of COVID-19. Here, we report
      that GABA treatment also reduced viral load in the lungs, suggesting that
      GABA-Rs may provide a new druggable target to limit pulmonary coronavirus
      replication. Histopathological analysis revealed that GABA treatment
      reduced lung inflammatory infiltrates and damages. Since GABA is safe for
      human consumption, inexpensive, and available worldwide, it is a promising
      candidate to help treat COVID-19.

    title: "The Joint Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical
      Interventions on Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: An
      Agent-Based Simulation"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to
      significantly reduce transmission and morbidity and mortality due to
      COVID-19. This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact
      of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without
      non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections,
      hospitalizations, and deaths. Methods: An agent-based simulation model was
      employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and
      COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 18 months for the
      State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine
      efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the
      end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination
      scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school
      closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of
      vaccine distribution. Results: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50%
      efficacy and 25% coverage), 2,231,134 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred
      with NPIs removed and 799,949 infections with NPIs maintained. In
      contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there
      were 450,575 new infections with NPIs maintained and 527,409 with NPIs
      removed. When NPIs were removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage
      (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy
      (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared to the worst-case scenario
      (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively). Conclusion: Simulation
      results suggest that premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are
      distributed may result in substantial increases in infections,
      hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher
      vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a
      larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to more
      efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Our findings highlight the need
      for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine
      coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many pre-pandemic
      activities can be resumed."

    title: Recovery of serum testosterone levels is an accurate predictor of
      survival from COVID-19 in male patients
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 portends a broad range of outcomes, from a
      majority of asymptomatic cases or mild clinical courses to a lethal
      disease. Robust correlates of severe COVID-19 include old age, male sex,
      poverty and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular
      disease. A precise knowledge is still lacking of the molecular and
      biological mechanisms that may explain the association of severe disease
      with male sex. Here, we show that testosterone trajectories are highly
      accurate individual predictors (AUC of ROC = 0.928, p < 0.0001) of
      survival in male COVID-19 patients. Longitudinal determinations of blood
      levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and androstenedione suggest an early
      modest inhibition of the central LH-androgen biosynthesis axis in a
      majority of patients, followed by either full recovery in survivors or a
      peripheral failure in lethal cases. Moreover, failure to reinstate
      physiological testosterone levels was associated with evidence of impaired
      T helper differentiation and decrease of non-classical monocytes. The
      strong association of recovery or failure to reinstate testosterone levels
      with survival or death from COVID-19 in male patients is suggestive of a
      significant role of testosterone status in the immune responses to
      COVID-19.

      This study may potentially allow better prognostics in Covid-19. If
      validated by further studies, it may even indicate that clinical trials of
      testosterone supplementation in male Covid-19 patients with low serum
      testosterone levels are warranted. 


      A recent study by Peruzzo et al. 2021 (Front Pharmacol. 2021 May 13;12:683529), titled “Synergy Between Vitamin D and Sex Hormones in Respiratory Functionality of Patients Affected by COVID-19” seems supportive for this preprint (and should be cited by the preprint authors). Peruzzo et al. observed “a significantly positive correlation between 17β-estradiol and 25(OH)D in elderly women and between testosterone and 25(OH)D in elderly men”. As Vitamin D is a well-established immune enhancer, it could be that the positive effects of higher serum testosterone reported in this preprint reflect higher  serum vitamin D. This aspect of their findings should be examined. 


      The authors of this preprint discuss the role of hyper-coagulation in severe Covid-19 as a key risk for fatal outcome. In this context, it is noteworthy that a recent meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials (Ayele et al. 2021; Thrombosis Research; PMID: 33486321) indicated that testosterone replacement therapy in men was not associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism. 


      Taken together, the authors suggestions that testosterone may be beneficial for male Covid-19 patients with low serum testosterone definitely warrants further research.

    title: Global inequity in scientific names and who they honor
    category: zoology
    abstract: "Linnaean taxonomy is a cornerstone of Western biology in which
      organisms are given a two-part name (a genus and species), creating
      biological units that help us order and manage our knowledge of the living
      world. In this system, the names of species themselves take on additional
      functions, such as describing features of the organism or honoring
      individuals (known as eponyms). Here, we interrogate how power and
      authority over the natural world are claimed through Western scientific
      naming practices to evaluate the legacies of imperialism, dispossession,
      and exclusion in these practices. We compile and analyze a dataset of all
      bird species descriptions from 1950 to present, asking: who has access and
      power to name species, and who is honored in species names? We show that
      95% of newly described species are described from the global South, but
      the majority of species and eponyms are described by authors, and named
      after individuals, from the global North. We find an increase through time
      in authors from the global South, which is associated with a rise in
      eponyms that honor individuals from global South countries. However, this
      formal inclusion of global South authors has not translated into increases
      in first authorship (a primary form of credit and authority in Western
      science). We contextualize these disparities in naming and authorship
      within broader global structures of access and power put in place through
      centuries of European and U.S. imperialism, but a historical perspective
      alone ignores institutional and individual agency and incentives in
      present-day actions. As we increasingly reflect on the social foundations
      and impacts of our science, these findings show how research and labor in
      the global South continue to be disproportionately translated into power
      and authority in the global North, upholding and re-enacting imperial
      structures of domination."

    abstract: On 11th March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health
      Organization (WHO). To date, there are rapidly spreading new "variants of
      concern" of SARS-CoV-2, the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), the South African
      (B.1.351) or Brasilian (P.1) variant. All of them contain multiple
      mutations in the ACE2 receptor recognition site of the spike protein,
      compared to the original Wuhan sequence, which is of great concern,
      because of their potential for immune escape. Here we report on the
      efficacy of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) to block protein-protein
      interaction of spike S1 to the human ACE2 cell surface receptor. This
      could be shown for the original spike D614, but also for its mutant forms
      (D614G, N501Y, and mix of K417N, E484K, N501Y) in human HEK293-hACE2
      kidney and A549-hACE2-TMPRSS2 lung cells. High molecular weight compounds
      in the water-based extract account for this effect. Infection of lung
      cells using SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus particles was
      efficiently prevented by the extract and so was virus-triggered
      pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 secretion. Modern herbal monographs
      consider the usage of this medicinal plant as safe. Thus, the in vitro
      results reported here should encourage further research on the clinical
      relevance and applicability of the extract as prevention strategy for
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    title: Genomic sequencing confirms absence of introgression despite past
      hybridisation between a critically endangered bird and its common congener
    category: genomics
    abstract: Genetic swamping resulting from interspecific hybridisation can
      increase extinction risk for threatened species. The development of
      high-throughput and reduced-representation genomic sequencing and analyses
      to generate large numbers of high resolution genomic markers has the
      potential to reveal introgression previously undetected using small
      numbers of genetic markers. However, few studies to date have implemented
      genomic tools to assess the extent of interspecific hybridisation in
      threatened species. Here we investigate the utility of genome-wide single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to detect introgression resulting from
      past interspecific hybridisation in one of the world's rarest birds.
      Anthropogenic impacts have resulted in hybridisation and subsequent
      backcrossing of the critically endangered Aotearoa New Zealand endemic
      kak[i] (black stilts; Himantopus novaezelandiae) with the non-threatened
      self-introduced congeneric poaka (Aotearoa New Zealand population of pied
      stilts, Himantopus himantopus leucocephalus), yet genetic analyses with a
      limited set of microsatellite markers revealed no evidence of
      introgression of poaka genetic material in kak[i], excluding one
      individual. We use genomic data for ~63% of the wild adult kak[i]
      population to reassess the extent of introgression resulting from
      hybridisation between kak[i] and poaka. Consistent with previous genetic
      analyses, we detected no introgression from poaka into kak[i]. These
      collective results indicate that, for kak[i], existing microsatellite
      markers provide a robust, cost-effective approach to detect cryptic
      hybrids. Further, for well-differentiated species, the use of genomic
      markers may not be required to detect admixed individuals.

    title: The maternal-fetal interface of successful pregnancies and impact of
      fetal sex using single cell sequencing
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: The first trimester is a critical window of maternal-fetal
      communication for pregnancy. Therefore, we characterized crosstalk in
      ongoing human pregnancies at 11-13 weeks gestation. RNA-sequencing of
      matched maternal decidua and placenta identified 818 receptors and 3502
      ligands, including 126 differentially expressed receptor-ligand pairs.
      Using single cell RNA-sequencing to further dissect placenta
      heterogeneity, we identified five major cell types (trophoblasts, stromal
      cells, hofbauer cells, antigen presenting cells and endothelial cells)
      with unique crosstalk at the maternal-fetal interface. We identified seven
      unique trophoblast subclusters, including new subtypes that transition
      into the terminal cell types, extra-villous trophoblasts and
      syncytiotrophoblasts. As fetal sex impacts pregnancy, we analyzed sex
      differences in each cell type and identified differences in immune cell
      function. TGFβ1, β-estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone emerge as upstream
      regulators of sexually dimorphic genes in a cell type specific manner.
      Thus, the fetal contribution at the maternal-fetal interface is cell and
      sex specific.

    title: Design principles of plant root morphogenesis
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: Understanding how an independent organ develops from the stem cell
      populations in the process called morphogenesis is a pressing challenge in
      developmental biology and medicine. Plants build up new organs such as
      roots to adjust their bodies to dynamic changes in the environment,
      thereby providing a tractable model to address this challenge. Here, we
      combined empirical data with advanced computer modeling techniques to
      build a mechanistic cell-based framework for the morphogenesis of the
      plant root. Our framework relies on experimentally supported design
      principles underlying the multi-layered feedback between tissue mechanics,
      cell growth, and directional cell-to-cell transport of growth regulator
      auxin. Model simulations reconstruct experimentally-observed patterns of
      anisotropic growth, auxin distribution, and cell polarity, as well as
      several root phenotypes caused by chemical, mechanical, or genetic
      perturbations. Furthermore, our model provides new insights into
      mechanisms of sustained root growth and cell polarity establishment. This
      work reveals that mobile auxin signal feeds back on cell polarity and
      growth mechanics to instruct the morphogenesis of an independent organ.

    title: "Intensified stimulation targeting lateral and medial prefrontal cortices
      for the treatment of social anxiety disorder: A randomized, double-blind,
      parallel-group, dose-comparison study"
    category: psychiatry-and-clinical-psychology
    abstract: "Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is the most common anxiety
      disorder while remains largely untreated. Disturbed amygdala-frontal
      network functions are central to the pathophysiology of SAD, marked by
      hypoactivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hypersensitivity
      of the medial PFC and amygdala. The objective of this study was to
      determine whether modulation of dorsolateral and medial PFC activity with
      a novel intensified stimulation protocol reduces SAD core symptoms,
      improves treatment-related variables, and reduces attention bias to
      threatening stimuli. Methods: In this randomized, sham-controlled,
      double-blind trial, we assessed the efficacy of an intensified stimulation
      protocol (20 min, twice-daily sessions with 20 min intervals, 5
      consecutive days) in two intensities (1 vs 2 mA) compared to sham
      stimulations. 45 patients with SAD were randomized in three tDCS arms. SAD
      symptoms, treatment-related variables (worries, depressive state, emotion
      regulation, quality of life), and attention bias to threatening stimuli
      (dot-probe paradigm) were assessed before and right after the
      intervention. SAD symptoms were also assessed at 2-month follow-up.
      Results: Both 1 mA and 2mA protocols significantly reduced fear/avoidance
      symptoms, worries and improved, emotion regulation and quality of life
      after the intervention compared to the sham group. Improving effect of the
      2 mA protocol on avoidance symptoms, worries and depressive state was
      significantly larger than the 1 mA group. Only the 2 mA protocol reduced
      attention bias to threat-related stimuli, the avoidance symptom at
      follow-up, and depressive states, as compared to the sham group.
      Conclusions: Modulation of lateral-medial PFC activity with intensified
      stimulation can improve cognitive control, motivation and emotion networks
      in SAD and thereby results in therapeutic effects. These effects can be
      larger with 2 mA vs 1 mA intensities, though a linear relationship between
      intensity and efficacy should not be concluded."

    title: Glucocorticoids and B Cell Depleting Agents Substantially Impair
      Immunogenicity of mRNA Vaccines to SARS-CoV-2
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: >-
      BackgroundIndividuals with chronic inflammatory diseases (CID) are
      frequently treated with immunosuppressive medications that can increase
      their risk of severe COVID-19. While novel mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2
      vaccination platforms provide robust protection in immunocompetent
      individuals, the immunogenicity in CID patients on immunosuppression is
      not well established. Therefore, determining the effectiveness of
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the setting of immunosuppression is essential to
      risk-stratify CID patients with impaired protection and provide clinical
      guidance regarding medication management.


      MethodsWe conducted a prospective assessment of mRNA-based vaccine immunogenicity in 133 adults with CIDs and 53 immunocompetent controls. Blood from participants over 18 years of age was collected before initial immunization and 1-2 weeks after the second immunization. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG+ binding, neutralizing antibody titers, and circulating S-specific plasmablasts were quantified to assess the magnitude and quality of the humoral response following vaccination.


      ResultsCompared to immunocompetent controls, a three-fold reduction in anti-S IgG titers (P=0.009) and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (p<0.0001) were observed in CID patients. B cell depletion and glucocorticoids exerted the strongest effect with a 36- and 10-fold reduction in humoral responses, respectively (p<0.0001). Janus kinase inhibitors and antimetabolites, including methotrexate, also blunted antibody titers in multivariate regression analysis (P<0.0001, P=0.0023, respectively). Other targeted therapies, such as TNF inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and integrin inhibitors, had only modest impacts on antibody formation and neutralization.


      ConclusionsCID patients treated with immunosuppressive therapies exhibit impaired SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immunity, with glucocorticoids and B cell depletion therapy more severely impeding optimal responses.

    title: "Diet quality and risk and severity of COVID-19: a prospective cohort
      study"
    category: nutrition
    abstract: "Objective: Poor metabolic health and certain lifestyle factors have
      been associated with risk and severity of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), but data for diet are lacking. We aimed to investigate the
      association of diet quality with risk and severity of COVID-19 and its
      intersection with socioeconomic deprivation. Design: We used data from
      592,571 participants of the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study. Diet
      quality was assessed using a healthful plant-based diet score, which
      emphasizes healthy plant foods such as fruits or vegetables. Multivariable
      Cox models were fitted to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CI) for COVID-19 risk and severity defined using a
      validated symptom-based algorithm or hospitalization with oxygen support,
      respectively. Results: Over 3,886,274 person-months of follow-up, 31,815
      COVID-19 cases were documented. Compared with individuals in the lowest
      quartile of the diet score, high diet quality was associated with lower
      risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) and severe COVID-19 (HR,
      0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74). The joint association of low diet quality and
      increased deprivation on COVID-19 risk was higher than the sum of the risk
      associated with each factor alone (Pinteraction=0.005). The corresponding
      absolute excess rate for lowest vs highest quartile of diet score was 22.5
      (95% CI, 18.8-26.3) and 40.8 (95% CI, 31.7-49.8; 10,000 person-months)
      among persons living in areas with low and high deprivation, respectively.
      Conclusions: A dietary pattern characterized by healthy plant-based foods
      was associated with lower risk and severity of COVID-19. These association
      may be particularly evident among individuals living in areas with higher
      socioeconomic deprivation."

      <i><b>a</b> healthful plant-based diet score</i>

      I read the text and couldn't find any further information about what this meant. There is much discussion of hPDI on the internet, but no publicly available calculator for it, and now I learn that there are a number of ways of working out a score for this and your team of researchers has chosen one of them based on your choice of phrase.

      I'm being harsh but unless this diet scoring system chosen was declared in advance of or independently of collecting the data, then this does not deserve to pass peer review.

      Make it public please.

    title: SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence among First Responders in Northeastern Ohio
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Objectives: First responders including firefighters, emergency
      medical technicians (EMT), paramedics, and police officers are working on
      the front lines to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and facing a higher risk of
      infection. This study assessed the seroprevalence among first responders
      in northeastern Ohio during May- September 2020. Methods: A survey and IgG
      antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 were offered to University Hospitals
      Health System affiliated first responder departments. Results: A total of
      3080 first responders with diverse job assignments from more than 400 fire
      and police departments participated in the study. Among them, 73 (2.4%)
      were seropositive while only 0.8% had previously positive RT-PCR results.
      Asymptomatic infection accounts for 46.6% of seropositivity. By
      occupation, seropositive rates were highest among administration/support
      staff (3.8%), followed by paramedics (3.0%), EMTs (2.6%), firefighters
      (2.2%), and police officers (0.8%). Seroprevalence was not associated with
      self-reported exposure as work exposure rates were: paramedics 48.2%,
      firefighters 37.1%, EMTs 32.3%, police officers 7.7%, and
      administration/support staff 4.4%. Self-reported community exposure was
      strongly correlated with self-reported work exposure rate rather than
      seroprevalence suggesting a potential impact of risk awareness.
      Additionally, no significant difference was found among gender or age
      groups; however, black Americans have a higher positivity rate than other
      races although they reported lower exposure. Conclusions: Despite the high
      work-associated exposure rate to SARS-CoV-2 infection, first responders
      with different roles demonstrated seroprevalence no higher than their
      administrative/supportive colleagues, which suggests infection control
      measures are effective in preventing work-related infection."

    title: Optogenetic stimulation of medial amygdala GABA neurons with kinetically
      different channelrhodopsin variants yield opposite behavioral outcomes

    category: neuroscience

    abstract: Optogenetic manipulation of genetically-specified neuron populations
      has become a key tool in circuit neuroscience. The medial amygdala (MeA)
      receives pheromone information about conspecifics and has crucial
      functions in social behaviors; interestingly, this amygdalar structure
      contains a majority of GABAergic projection neurons. A previous study
      showed that optogenetic activation of MeA GABA neurons with
      channelrhodopsin-2H134R (ChR2) strongly enhanced inter-male aggression
      (Hong et al. 2014, Cell). When we attempted to reproduce these findings,
      accidentally using a faster channelrhodopsin variant
      (channelrhodopsin-2H134R,E123T or ChETA), we found the opposite results.
      We therefore systematically compared the behavioral outcome of optogenetic
      stimulation of MeApd GABA neurons with ChETA versus ChR2, employing two
      widely used AAV serotypes. This revealed that optogenetic stimulation with
      ChETA suppressed aggression, whereas optogenetic stimulation with ChR2
      increased aggression. Recordings of membrane potential changes following
      optogenetic stimulation with ChETA versus ChR2 revealed larger plateau
      depolarizations, smaller action potential amplitudes, and larger local
      inhibition of neighboring inhibitory neurons with ChR2 as compared to
      ChETA. Our study shows that channelrhodopsin variants have to be chosen
      with care for in-vivo optogenetic experiments. Furthermore, the role of
      MeApd GABA neurons in aggression control should be re-evaluated.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      because SA probably has a significantly more accurate and sophisticated
      system for recording of COVID deaths and infections than other countries
      on the continent. Albeit that under the post 1994 ANC Government, our
      health system has been in  steady decline for last 27 years... and well
      below 1st world standards  like US, UK, and richer European countries.

      Hello Iñigo, thanks a lot for your feedbacks and for reporting this error
      in the manuscript. You are correct; BRAF mutations are less frequent in
      thyroid papillary cancer patients with bone metastasis (76% vs 52%)
      (Figure 4 and table S8 are correct tho). Preprints are useful.

    title: "Transcranial Bipolar Direct Current Stimulation of the Frontoparietal
      Cortex Reduces Ketamine-Induced Oscillopathies: A Pilot Study in the
      Sedated Rat"
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: >-
      During the prodromal phase of schizophrenia with its complex and insidious
      clinical picture, electroencephalographic recordings detect widespread
      oscillation disturbances (or oscillopathies). Neural oscillations are
      electro-biomarkers of the connectivity state within systems. A single
      systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA glutamate
      receptor antagonist, transiently reproduces the oscillopathies with a
      clinical picture reminiscent of the psychosis prodrome. This acute
      pharmacological model may help the research and development of innovative
      treatments against the psychotic transition. Transcranial electrical
      stimulation is recognized as an appropriate non-invasive therapeutic
      modality since it can increase cognitive performance and modulate neural
      oscillations with little or no side effects. Therefore, our objective was
      to set up, in the sedated adult rat, a stimulation method able to
      normalize the ketamine-induced oscillopathies. Unilateral transcranial
      frontoparietal anodal stimulation by direct current (<+1 mA) was applied
      in ketamine-treated rats. A concomitant electroencephalographic recording
      of the parietal cortex measured the stimulation effects on its
      spontaneously-occurring oscillations. A 5-min bipolar anodal tDCS
      immediately and quickly reduced, significantly with an intensity-effect
      relationship, the ketamine-induced oscillopathies at least in the
      bilateral parietal cortex. A duration effect was also recorded. These
      preliminary neurophysiological findings are promising for developing a
      therapeutic proof-of-concept against neuropsychiatric disorders.

      The authors thank the anonymous Transl Neurosci reviewers who positively
      assessed with constructive comments the manuscript.


      To better justify and understand the technical design and the statistical approaches, the authors added detailed arguments with new references in both the introduction and the methods. Also, to better clarify the course of the experiments, the repeated protocols/measures in one animal are now the object of a paragraph in the methods section.


      In this pilot study, the used strategy allowed the investigators to quickly move towards another stimulation protocol (a new combination of parameters), predicted effective based on the ongoing datasets, their knowledge, and expertise. As specified in the result section, the parametrization of the FP tDCS began according to an empirical and pragmatic approach. In any animal, it was possible to apply 2 to 3 stimulation protocols. Moreover, when the stimulation was not effective concerning the goal of the present study, there was no interest in pursuing further experiments on a greater number of animals. So, having in mind the 3R rule, the authors attempted to adjust the protocol and reduce the animal number. The present datasets remain “preliminary” as it was impossible to test, in a reasonable time, all the possible combinations (extraordinarily large number) of the stimulation parameters. As discussed, the authors cannot exclude having missed the best parameters.


      Why ketamine oscillopathies under pentobarbital sedation?

      Pinault’s laboratory demonstrated that the ketamine-induced gamma hyperactivity recorded in free-behaving rats could also be recorded in (urethane or pentobarbital) anesthetized rats (Hakami et al., 2009). Our multiple experiences with urethane anesthesia (Pinault and Pumain, 1989; Pinault and Deschenes, 1992; Hakami et al., 2009) led us to conclude that the quality of the recordings is not stable over time, preventing us from performing repeated measures. The pentobarbital is also well-known to induce delta-waves and sleep spindles (Connor et al., 2003; Ganes and Andersen, 1975; Pinault et al., 2006), and the pentobarbital preparation is stable and adjustable at will via an EEG-driven infusion rate of the sedative regimen. 

      The major requirement of the present study was to have the equivalent of a stationary stage II non-REM sleep, during which the authors could perform repeated measures using a minimal number of animals. Furthermore, under the present experimental conditions (pentobarbital-induced sedation), a single systemic administration of ketamine at a psychotomimetic dose (2.5 mg/kg, SC, estimated from a study conducted in free-behaving rats: Pinault, Biol Psychiatry, 2008) induces most of the oscillopathies (especially gamma hyperactivity and delta/spindle hypoactivity) recorded in patients having psychotic disorders. 

      One advantage of the pentobarbital-induced sedation - a maintained state electrophysiologically equivalent to stage II non-REM sleep - was its stability over time, allowing to assess the stimulation parameters under more than one condition; also, the repeated measures allowed to decrease the animal number (already discussed in the main text). 

      As a corollary, one major limitation is the dependence of tDCS on brain state (Li et al., Human Brain Mapp, 2019; Luft et al., Brain Stimulation, 2018). So, the tested parameters set under pentobarbital-induced sedation highlight the importance of considering the brain state when it comes to adjusting the stimulation parameters in any, experimental or clinical, studies. A paragraph was added at the end of the subsection “Technical considerations”.


      One referee raised an interesting issue to be discussed, the possible relationship between the convulsive therapy of schizophrenia patients by electrical or magnetic stimulation of the frontal lobe. The authors were not convinced it is the heart of the matter in an experimental study focused on TES… Electro-convulsive therapy is applied in patients with chronic, advanced schizophrenia and resistance to medication, including clozapine (e.g., see Sanghani et al., Curr Opin Psychiatry, 2018). In the present study, we used an acute model for psychosis transition, not for chronic schizophrenia. From a clinical point of view, TES (tDCS or tACS), not ECT, is expected to be applied in patients at a clinically high-risk mental state for transition to psychotic disorders (Rabanea-Souza et al, Trials, 2019). On the other hand, in the discussion, a paragraph was added to present a translational vision mentioning questions the authors thought relevant, regarding the potential clinical application of the tDCS in individuals having a clinically at-risk mental state for developing a psychosis transition while the ketamine model induces a brain state simulating that of patients transitioning to a psychotic state.

    title: On the permeability of cell membranes subjected to lipid oxidation
    category: biophysics
    abstract: >-
      The formation of transient hydrophilic pores in their membranes is a
      well-recognized mechanism of permeabilization of cells exposed to
      high-intensity electric pulses. However, the formation of such pores alone
      is not able to explain all aspects of the so-called electroporation
      phenomenon. In particular, the reasons for the sustained permeability of
      cell membranes, which persist long after the pulses application, remain
      elusive. The complete resealing of the cell membranes takes indeed orders
      of magnitude longer than the time of electropore closure as reported from
      molecular modelling investigations. A possible alternative mechanism to
      explain the observed long-lived permeability of cell membranes, lipid
      peroxidation, has been previously suggested but the theoretical
      investigations of membrane lesions, containing excess amounts of
      hydroperoxides, have shown that the conductivities of such lesions were
      not high enough to reasonably explain the entire range of experimental
      measurements. Here, we expand on these studies and investigate the
      permeability of cell membrane lesions that underwent secondary oxidation.
      Molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations on lipid
      bilayers in different states show that such lesions provide a better model
      for post-pulsed permeable and conductive electropermeabilized cells. These
      results are further discussed in context of sonoporation and ferroptosis,
      respectively a procedure and a phenomena, among others, in which alike
      electroporation substantial lipid oxidation might be triggered.


      HighlightsO_LIThe contribution of secondary lipids oxidation to the permeabilization of model membranes is quantitatively assessed

      C_LIO_LISmall patches of secondary lipids oxidation cause formation long-lived pores in lipid bilayers.

      C_LIO_LIThe cholesterol content of membranes enhances the life-time of the formed pores.

      C_LIO_LIA single pore accounts for the measured post-pulse electropermeabilization of cells.

      C_LIO_LIThe diffusion of the secondary oxidation lipids, even after pores closure leads to permeability of lipid membrane.

    title: The maternal-fetal interface of successful pregnancies and impact of
      fetal sex using single cell sequencing
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: The first trimester is a critical window of maternal-fetal
      communication for pregnancy. Therefore, we characterized crosstalk in
      ongoing human pregnancies at 11-13 weeks gestation. RNA-sequencing of
      matched maternal decidua and placenta identified 818 receptors and 3502
      ligands, including 126 differentially expressed receptor-ligand pairs.
      Using single cell RNA-sequencing to further dissect placenta
      heterogeneity, we identified five major cell types (trophoblasts, stromal
      cells, hofbauer cells, antigen presenting cells and endothelial cells)
      with unique crosstalk at the maternal-fetal interface. We identified seven
      unique trophoblast subclusters, including new subtypes that transition
      into the terminal cell types, extra-villous trophoblasts and
      syncytiotrophoblasts. As fetal sex impacts pregnancy, we analyzed sex
      differences in each cell type and identified differences in immune cell
      function. TGFβ1, β-estradiol, and dihydrotestosterone emerge as upstream
      regulators of sexually dimorphic genes in a cell type specific manner.
      Thus, the fetal contribution at the maternal-fetal interface is cell and
      sex specific.

    title: "Long-term symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in school children:
      population-based cohort with 6-months follow-up. Short Report"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Although nobody doubts the existence of long COVID in children, it is
      still unclear to what extent children are affected. The Ciao Corona study
      is a longitudinal cohort investigating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and
      clustering of cases among around 2500 children from 55 randomly selected
      primary and secondary schools in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland.
      Between June 2020 and April 2021, we completed three testing phases where
      we collected venous blood for serological analysis (ABCORA 2.0 test) and
      asked about symptoms with online questionnaires. We compared children who
      tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in October/November 2020 with
      those who tested negative. Children who were seronegative in
      October/November 2020 and seroconverted or were not retested by
      March/April 2021 were excluded from the analysis (n=256). In March-May
      2021 we assessed the presence of symptoms occurring since October 2020,
      lasting for at least 4 weeks, and persisting for either >4 weeks or >12
      weeks. Overall, 1355 of 2503 children with a serology result in
      October/November 2020 and follow up questionnaire in March/April 2021 were
      included. Among seropositive and seronegative 6-to 16-year-old children
      and adolescents, 9% versus 10% reported at least one symptom beyond 4
      weeks, and 4% versus 2% at least one symptom beyond 12 weeks. None of the
      seropositive children reported hospitalization after October 2020.
      Seropositive children, all with a history of pauci-symptomatic SARS-CoV-2
      infection, did not report long COVID more frequently than seronegative
      children. This study suggests a very low prevalence of long COVID in a
      randomly selected population-based cohort of children followed over 6
      months after serological testing.

    raw_message: The authors fail to describe the online questionnaire - did it
      restrict the set of symptoms that were able to be reported? Did it allow
      entry of non-predefined symptoms? Did it include a severity scale for each
      reported symptom? The precise questioning schema might have a very
      significant effect on the results which seem obviously in contradiction to
      e.g. UK ONS data.

    abstract: "The recent emergence of B.1.617 lineage has created grave public
      health problem in India. The lineage further mutated to generate
      sub-lineages B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.3. Apparently,
      the Delta variant has slowly dominated the other variants including
      B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.3. With this, World Health
      Organization has described this sub-lineage as variant of concern. The
      high transmissibility associated with Delta variant has led to second wave
      of pandemic in India which affected millions of people. Besides this,
      variant of concerns has been reported to show lower neutralization to
      several approved vaccines. This has led to breakthrough infections after
      completion of vaccination regimen. There is limited information available
      on the duration of protective immune response post-infection, vaccination
      or breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we have
      evaluated immune response in sera of the Covishield vaccinated individuals
      belonging to category: I. one dose vaccinated, II. two doses vaccinated,
      III. COVID-19 recovered plus one dose vaccinated, IV. COVID-19 recovered
      plus two doses vaccinated and V. breakthrough COVID-19 cases. The findings
      of the study demonstrated that the breakthrough cases and the COVID-19
      recovered individuals with one or two dose of vaccine had relatively
      higher protection against Delta variant in comparison to the participants
      who were administered either one or two doses of Covishield. Prior
      vaccination results in less severe disease against subsequent infection
      provide evidence that both humoral and cellular immune response play an
      important role in protection."

    title: Broad decline and subsequent differential re-emergence of respiratory
      viruses during COVID-19 pandemic response measures, Singapore 2020
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Importance. COVID-19 pandemic control measures affect the prevalence
      of other respiratory viruses. Effects on some viruses have been described;
      however, the broader impact and temporal relationship of control measures
      on virus decline and subsequent re-emergence have not been thoroughly
      documented. Understanding these phenomena may influence health policies.
      Objective. To examine the prevalence of unrelated respiratory viruses in
      relation to population-wide pandemic response measures and phases in 2020
      in Singapore. Design, Setting, and Participants. Data from respiratory
      multiplex PCRs from 3 major hospitals (total 3700 beds) in Singapore were
      collated. The full dataset consisted of 42,558 test results, 19,898 from
      2019 and 22,660 from 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures. Weekly virus
      prevalence data were mapped onto prevailing pandemic response measures, in
      order to elucidate temporal relationships and differential virus
      responses. Pre-pandemic data from 2019 were compared with data from 2020.
      Results. Early response measures, even before national lockdown, were
      followed by a dramatic reduction of influenza viruses and a more gradual
      decline of other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial
      virus, parainfluenza viruses, endemic coronaviruses and metapneumovirus.
      Marked decline of enterovirus/rhinovirus and adenovirus, however, was only
      observed during lockdown. About 13 weeks into phased reopening,
      enterovirus/rhinovirus re-emerged, followed by adenovirus, the latter
      mainly in the pediatric population. All other viruses remained at low
      levels until the end of 2020. Conclusions and Relevance. COVID-19 control
      measures in Singapore had a significant impact on a broad range of
      respiratory viruses. Effects of various control measures varied between
      phases and different viruses. Influenza viruses declined earliest and most
      dramatically; relaxation of measures was followed by re-emergence of
      enterovirus/rhinovirus and adenovirus. These patterns are presumably a
      result of different propensities for contact versus droplet and overall
      ease of transmission, and different virus reservoirs. Further studies into
      these phenomena are a matter of public health importance.

    title: "The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries
      during the COVID-19 pandemic"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or
      across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths
      can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess
      mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the
      recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the
      COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central,
      frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across
      countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or
      quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as
      the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to
      compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality
      increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by
      over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID
      mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been
      reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been
      underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more.
      Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the world's COVID-19
      death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of
      confirmed deaths.

      Dear authors,


      you write: "For each country we predicted the ‘baseline’ mortality in 2020 based on the 2015–2019 data (accounting for linear trend and seasonal variation; see Methods). We then obtained excess mortality as the difference between the actual 2020 and 2021 all-cause mortality and our baseline. For each country we computed the total excess mortality from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 2020) (Figure 2, Table 1)"


      For Germany Table 1 shows 36.000 excess deaths, which makes up 4% increase, suggesting a baseline of 900.000 for March 2020 - Mai 23th 2021.

      According to destatis

      https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Gesellschaft-Umwelt/Bevoelkerung/Sterbefaelle-Lebenserwartung/Tabellen/sonderauswertung-sterbefaelle.html

      the yearly number of deaths for 2015-2019 in Germany was always above 900.000.

      How can your baseline for a timespan of ~14 month be lower than the actual number of deaths for 12 months within the last years?

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

      The JVCI seem to be using this paper as the sole source for justifying an
      8-week gap for Pfizer in younger cohorts, despite the fact that the sample
      for this paper is 172 people aged 80 or over. Not by any stretch a fair
      representation of the population. It would be hard to argue that it is
      even possible to get a fair representation of genders, ages and
      ethnicities with a sample of 172 alone. 


      With this is mind, what response do the authors give to the fact that this paper is being used to justify the current 8-week policy for second doses of Pfizer and Moderna when this paper does not make any attempt to back up that justification for younger cohorts, especially when the manufacturer and WHO recommend a 21-28 day gap between doses?

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      No mention of vitamin D levels here. A vitamin D level above 50 ng/ML
      reduces mortality by 900% and significant morbidity requiring
      hospitalization by 300%. Masks have never been shown to do any of this.
      The fact is, masks were nothing more than virtue signaling and really
      didn't do very much at all. You failed to mention previous studies on
      influenza where it was proven that masks a little difference. Plus, you
      conveniently avoid the downside of masks. Remember "risk versus benefit",
      no? To wit:


      "Prolonged mask use (>4 hours per day) promotes facial alkalinization and inadvertently encourages dehydration, which in turn can enhance barrier breakdown and bacterial infection risk. British clinicians have reported masks to increase headaches and sweating and decrease cognitive precision. Survey bias notwithstanding, these sequelae are associated with medical errors. By obscuring nonverbal communication, masks interfere with social learning in children. Likewise, masks can distort verbal speech and remove visual cues to the detriment of individuals with hearing loss; clear face-shields improve visual integration, but there is a corresponding loss of sound quality."


      Please look at the ridiculous downside of wearing the silly things that do nothing for protection. If you want me to pull up all the references, I will. But it is tiresome. Please do your own research. Masks are silly and did absolutely nothing for transmission.

      I pulled up a bunch of studies that showed how masks work and posted them
      earlier, none of them called masks silly. You did nothing to address
      either them or what I just write, so why would I care what your sources
      are. You ae not rigorous enough. 


      I should point out that those of us who wear masks, change them, throwing away the disposable ones, and washing the others. If "prolonged mask use" is what you've been afraid of, you can change them.

    title: Identification of a novel lineage bat SARS-related coronaviruses that use
      bat ACE2 receptor
    category: microbiology
    abstract: Severe respiratory disease coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the most
      devastating disease, COVID-19, of the recent century. One of the unsolved
      scientific questions around SARS-CoV-2 is the animal origin of this virus.
      Bats and pangolins are recognized as the most probable reservoir hosts
      that harbor the highly similar SARS-CoV-2 related viruses (SARSr-CoV-2).
      Here, we report the identification of a novel lineage of SARSr-CoVs,
      including RaTG15 and seven other viruses, from bats at the same location
      where we found RaTG13 in 2015. Although RaTG15 and the related viruses
      share 97.2% amino acid sequence identities to SARS-CoV-2 in the conserved
      ORF1b region, but only show less than 77.6% to all known SARSr-CoVs in
      genome level, thus forms a distinct lineage in the Sarbecovirus
      phylogenetic tree. We then found that RaTG15 receptor binding domain (RBD)
      can bind to and use Rhinolophus affinis bat ACE2 (RaACE2) but not human
      ACE2 as entry receptor, although which contains a short deletion and has
      different key residues responsible for ACE2 binding. In addition, we show
      that none of the known viruses in bat SARSr-CoV-2 lineage or the novel
      lineage discovered so far use human ACE2 efficiently compared to
      SARSr-CoV-2 from pangolin or some of the SARSr-CoV-1 lineage viruses.
      Collectively, we suggest more systematic and longitudinal work in bats to
      prevent future spillover events caused by SARSr-CoVs or to better
      understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2.

    title: "Efficacy, safety, and lot to lot immunogenicity of an inactivated
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152): a double-blind, randomised, controlled phase
      3 trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We report the clinical efficacy against COVID 19
      infection of BBV152, a whole virion inactivated SARS CoV 2 vaccine
      formulated with a Toll like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum
      (Algel IMDG). Methods: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre,
      phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age
      18 to 98 years) randomised 1:1 using a sponsor-supplied randomisation
      scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered
      four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory confirmed symptomatic
      COVID 19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary
      outcomes were efficacy in subgroups for age (18 to < 60 years and >=60
      years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We
      also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses
      for three consecutive manufacturing lots. Findings: Between November 16,
      2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were
      randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of
      BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198). In a case-driven analysis,
      130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in 16,973 (0.77%)
      participants with follow-up at least two weeks after the second
      vaccination; 24 occurred in the vaccine group and 106 in placebo
      recipients giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI:
      65.2,86.4). Sixteen cases, one vaccinee and 15 placebo recipients, met the
      severe symptomatic COVID-19 case definition giving a vaccine efficacy of
      93.4% (57.1,99.8). Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID 19 was 63.6% (29.0,
      82.4). BBV152 conferred 65.2% (95% CI: 33.1, 83.0) protection against the
      SARS CoV 2 Variant of Concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta). BBV152 was well
      tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in
      the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events
      between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or
      vaccine-related deaths were reported. Interpretation: BBV152 was
      immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic
      COVID 19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease
      in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of
      adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that
      observed with other COVID-19 vaccines."

    title: The role of feedback in the production of skilled finger sequences

    category: neuroscience

    abstract: Actions involving fine control of the hand, for example grasping an
      object, rely heavily on sensory information from the fingertips. While the
      integration of feedback during execution of individual movements is well
      understood, less is known about the use of sensory feedback in the control
      of skilled movement sequences. To address this gap, we trained
      participants to produce sequences of finger movements on a keyboard-like
      device over a four-day training period. Participants received haptic,
      visual, and auditory feedback indicating the occurrence of each finger
      press. We then either transiently delayed or advanced the feedback for a
      single press by a small amount of time (30 or 60 ms). We observed that
      participants rapidly adjusted their ongoing finger press by either
      accelerating or prolonging the ongoing press, in accordance with the
      direction of the perturbation. Furthermore, we could show that this rapid
      behavioural modulation was driven by haptic feedback. While these
      feedback-driven adjustments reduced in size with practice, they were still
      clearly present at the end of training. In contrast to the
      directionally-specific effect we observed on the perturbed press, a
      feedback perturbation resulted in a delayed onset of the subsequent
      presses irrespective of perturbation direction or feedback modality. This
      observation is consistent with a hierarchical organization of skilled
      movement sequences, with different levels reacting distinctly to sensory
      perturbations.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    title: A new transgene mouse model using an extravesicular EGFP tag to elucidate
      the in vivo function of extracellular vesicles
    category: molecular-biology
    abstract: The in vivo function of cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) is
      challenging to establish since cell-specific EVs are difficult to isolate.
      We therefore created an EV reporter using CD9 to display enhanced green
      fluorescent protein (EGFP) on the EV surface. CD9-EGFP expression in cells
      did not affect EV size and concentration, but allowed for co-precipitation
      of EV markers TSG101 and ALIX from cell-conditioned medium by anti-GFP
      immunoprecipitation. We created a transgenic mouse where CD9-EGFP was
      inserted in the inverse orientation and double-floxed, ensuring Cre
      recombinase-dependent EV reporter expression. We crossed the EV reporter
      mice with mice expressing Cre ubiquitously (CMV-Cre), in cardiomyocytes
      (AMHC-Cre) and kidney epithelium (Pax8-Cre), respectively. The mice showed
      tissue-specific EGFP expression, and plasma and urine samples were used to
      immunoprecipitate EVs. CD9-EGFP EVs was detected in plasma samples from
      CMV-Cre/CD9-EGFP and AMHC-Cre/CD9-EGFP mice, but not in PAX8-Cre/CD9-EGFP
      mice. On the other hand, CD9-EGFP EVs were detected in urine samples from
      CMV-Cre/CD9-EGFP and PAX8-Cre/CD9-EGFP mice, but not AMHC-Cre/CD9-EGFP,
      indicating that plasma EVs are not filtered to the urine. In conclusion,
      our EV reporter mouse model enables Cre-dependent EV labeling, providing a
      new approach to study cell-specific EVs in vivo and gain new insight into
      their physiological and pathophysiological function.

      The authors report mouse lines producing a “CD9-truncated”-EGFP reporter
      protein with a

      purpose of labeling the surface of extracellular vesicles with EGFP. However, the original version of EGFP is prone to two well described artifacts when expressed as 1) a membrane-tethered protein; 2) a protein passing the oxidizing intracellular compartments (ER, secretory pathways, etc). The current reporter construct is subject to both of these factors because it is membrane-tethered and passes through the ER interior being on ER/extracellular-side of the membrane in this fusion (tethered to the extracellular side of CD9 truncated after the first 117 amino acid residues). In the first case, the tendency of FP to oligomerize causes aggregate-like membrane structures; in the second case, the ER is flooded with a “dark” FP pool due to intermolecular cysteine cross-linking as described on Addgene blog (and in the original paper by Constantini et al, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0854.2012.01336.x):



      1) https://blog.addgene.org/when-is-a-monomer-not-a-monomer-the-top-three-ways-your-favorite-fluorescent-protein-oligomerizes-in-cells



      2) https://blog.addgene.org/avoiding-the-dark-side-of-fluorescent-protein-fusions-with-mox-fps



      These two problems were extensively reported by groups developing improved fluorescent proteins (FPs) over the last decade. Monomeric (widely used now) and cysteine-less (less

      widely used) variants of FPs are available to address both of these problems. In case of EGFP, these are monomeric (mEGFP) and monomeric+cysteine-less versions (moxGFP) but currently there are many newer fluorescent proteins which are superior to EGFP (even if considering ones having similar spectral characteristics).



      Therefore, the use of the current described reporter should be generally avoided. Ideally, these reporters should be redone using moxGFP or other suitable FP.



      The use of protein tools representing the best current state-of-the-art is particular important for rodent work due to ethical considerations. Currently in most countries there is a pressure to reduce unnecessary use of vertebrate animals in research. The use of constructs prone to artifacts in vertebrate models could result in using more animals than needed since it may be required to redo the live animal tools or redo some of the research obtained with less than optimal tools.

    title: Discovery and visualization of uncharacterized drug-protein adducts using
      mass spectrometry.
    category: pharmacology-and-toxicology
    abstract: Drugs are often metabolized to reactive intermediates that form
      protein adducts. Adducts can inhibit protein activity, elicit immune
      responses, and cause life threatening adverse drug reactions. The masses
      of reactive metabolites are frequently unknown, rendering traditional mass
      spectrometry-based proteomics approaches incapable of adduct
      identification. Here, we present Magnum, an open-mass search algorithm
      optimized for adduct identification, and Limelight, a web-based data
      processing package for analysis and visualization of data from all
      existing algorithms. Limelight incorporates tools for sample comparisons
      and xenobiotic-adduct discovery. We validate our tools with two
      drug/protein combinations and apply our workflow to identify novel
      xenobiotic-protein adducts in CYP3A4. Our new methods and software enable
      accurate identification of xenobiotic-protein adducts with no prior
      knowledge of adduct masses or protein targets. Magnum outperforms existing
      tools in xenobiotic-protein adduct discovery, while Limelight fulfills a
      major need in the rapidly developing field of open-mass searching, which
      until now lacked comprehensive data visualization tools.

      and my motivation was similar to that of the authors, in that we sought to
      selectively visualize modifications associated with a particular treatment
      (in our case, 'treatment' meant addition of a reactive chemical in vitro,
      and we used some data from others' studies - one involving a probe and one
      involving a drug).

    title: "Efficacy, safety, and lot to lot immunogenicity of an inactivated
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152): a double-blind, randomised, controlled phase
      3 trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We report the clinical efficacy against COVID 19
      infection of BBV152, a whole virion inactivated SARS CoV 2 vaccine
      formulated with a Toll like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum
      (Algel IMDG). Methods: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre,
      phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age
      18 to 98 years) randomised 1:1 using a sponsor-supplied randomisation
      scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered
      four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory confirmed symptomatic
      COVID 19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary
      outcomes were efficacy in subgroups for age (18 to < 60 years and >=60
      years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We
      also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses
      for three consecutive manufacturing lots. Findings: Between November 16,
      2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were
      randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of
      BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198). In a case-driven analysis,
      130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in 16,973 (0.77%)
      participants with follow-up at least two weeks after the second
      vaccination; 24 occurred in the vaccine group and 106 in placebo
      recipients giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI:
      65.2,86.4). Sixteen cases, one vaccinee and 15 placebo recipients, met the
      severe symptomatic COVID-19 case definition giving a vaccine efficacy of
      93.4% (57.1,99.8). Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID 19 was 63.6% (29.0,
      82.4). BBV152 conferred 65.2% (95% CI: 33.1, 83.0) protection against the
      SARS CoV 2 Variant of Concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta). BBV152 was well
      tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in
      the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events
      between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or
      vaccine-related deaths were reported. Interpretation: BBV152 was
      immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic
      COVID 19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease
      in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of
      adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that
      observed with other COVID-19 vaccines."

      Major protocol violations occurred at the largest site of the Covaxin
      phase 3 trial, a private hospital called People's Hospital, which
      recruited 1700 participants. These violations are documented extensively
      by multiple media outlets. And these violations raise questions about the
      integrity of the Phase 3 trial data. They also raise questions about the
      sponsors' attitude to due process, and the independence/training of the
      DSMB: both sponsors (the Indian Council of Medical Research and Bharat
      Biotech) responded to the allegations with cursory dismissals, while the
      DSMB remained mum.


      Further details here: https://www.thequint.com/coronavirus/explained-is-the-data-from-covaxin-trials-bhopal-site-tainted-bharat-biotech-icmr 


      I am listing a few of the documented irregularities:


      1. Participants told media outlets that they didn't give their informed consent, an Indian legal requirement. Many participants belonged to disadvantaged tribal communities/were illiterate, which necessitates special consent protocols under Indian law, which investigators didn't follow. 


      Investigators admitted in a video-recorded press conference that they didn't give participants a copy of their informed-consent form during their first visit, unless participants explicitly asked for it. This strongly suggests that the investigators weren't trained in Indian legal requirements or Good Clinical Practices.



      2. Investigators allegedly advertised the trial as a vaccination drive in communities of poor and illiterate people.



      3. Dozens of participants say the trial team did not contact them to record solicited adverse events. These participants often didn't have their own mobile phones (mobile phones are the mode through which solicited adverse events were to be collected, as per trial protocol). Even though these participants came from poor communities, investigators didn't foresee the fact that they may not have their own mobile phones, and may be hard to contact. Nor did they attempt to contact them in their homes in the days following the doses. 



      4. People's Hospital recruited a record 1700 participants in 1.5 months (no other Covaxin trial site in India managed such numbers). In contrast, another government-run  Covaxin site in Bhopal struggled to even recruit a few hundred participants, and was, therefore, excluded from the trial. This supports the allegation that People's Hospital misadvertised the trial as a vaccination drive.



      5. Many participants told media outlets that they suffered Covid-like symptoms post jab, but the investigators never called them to collect this information. Nor did the participants know where to report their symptoms. This raises questions about how well Covid cases were recorded. 



      6. Participants say they were denied medical treatment at People's Hospital when they fell sick. This, again, raises questions about how well the investigators captured adverse-events.



      7. When one participant at the Bhopal site died, investigators ignored his family's version of the participant's symptoms in their causality analysis. In the family's version, the participant suffered from very severe symptoms (vomiting, dizziness, weakness) for 7-8 days before death, while the investigators claimed he was fine during solicited-adverse event monitoring, and died suddenly. 


      The dismissal of the family's version of events, when the family was present during the participant's death (but the investigators weren't), raises serious questions about how Serious Adverse Events are investigated. No post-mortem report or causality analysis was shared with the family despite multiple requests. Further, the family alleges that the deceased participant received no phone calls from the investigators to record solicited adverse events in the days leading up to his death. 


      The investigators could easily have shared proof of their claims by sharing a record of the phone calls with the family. They haven't. 


      --------------------------------------------------------------


      Despite the above serious concerns (which are supported by video testimony from participants broadcast on multiple media outlets, specifically NDTV),  the trial's government sponsor, ICMR, and Bharat Biotech, denied all allegations in a cursory manner. Further, the preprint makes no mention of them, or explain how these irregularities were handled. 


      This raises questions about overall data integrity in Bharat Biotech's phase 3 trial. Bharat Biotech has been under substantial pressure from the government to roll out Covaxin fast, which may explain why the company is overlooking such data integrity issues. More details here: https://www.livemint.com/science/news/how-covaxin-became-a-victim-of-vaccine-triumphalism-11622022760541.html


      Reviewers of this paper, and licensing authorities, including the World Health Organisation, must investigate these allegations thoroughly.

      vaccine-related deaths were reported. Interpretation: BBV152 was
      immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic
      COVID 19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease
      in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of
      adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that
      observed with other COVID-19 vaccines."

    title: Modular biosynthesis of plant hemicellulose and its impact on yeast cells
    category: bioengineering
    abstract: "Background: The carbohydrate polymers that encapsulate plants cells
      have benefited humans for centuries and have valuable biotechnological
      uses. In the past five years, exciting possibilities have emerged in the
      engineering of polysaccharide-based biomaterials. Despite impressive
      advances on bacterial cellulose-based hydrogels, comparatively little is
      known about how plant hemicelluloses can be reconstituted and modulated in
      cells suitable for biotechnological purposes. Results: Here, we assembled
      cellulose synthase-like A (CSLA) enzymes using an optimized Pichia
      pastoris platform to produce tunable heteromannan (HM) polysaccharides in
      yeast. By swapping the domains of plant mannan and glucomannan synthases,
      we engineered chimeric CSLA proteins that made {beta}-1,4-linked mannan in
      quantities surpassing those of the native enzymes while minimizing the
      burden on yeast growth. Prolonged expression of a glucomannan synthase
      from Amorphophallus konjac was toxic to yeast cells: reducing biomass
      accumulation and ultimately leading to compromised cell viability.
      However, an engineered glucomannan synthase as well as CSLA pure mannan
      synthases and a CSLC glucan synthase did not inhibit growth.
      Interestingly, Pichia cell size could be increased or decreased depending
      on the composition of the CSLA protein sequence. HM yield and glucose
      incorporation could be further increased by co-expressing chimeric CSLA
      proteins with a MANNAN-SYNTHESIS-RELATED (MSR) co-factor from Arabidopsis
      thaliana. Conclusion: The results provide novel routes for the engineering
      of polysaccharide-based biomaterials that are needed for a sustainable
      bioeconomy. The characterization of chimeric cellulose synthase-like
      enzymes in yeast offers an exciting avenue to produce plant
      polysaccharides in a tunable manner. Furthermore, cells modified with
      non-toxic plant polysaccharides such as {beta}-mannan offer a modular
      chassis to produce and encapsulate sensitive cargo such as therapeutic
      proteins."

    abstract: Trust is a nebulous construct central to successful cooperative
      exchanges and interpersonal relationships. In this study, we introduce a
      new approach to establishing construct validity of trust using
      neurometrics. We develop a whole-brain multivariate pattern capable of
      classifying whether new participants will trust a relationship partner in
      the context of a cooperative interpersonal investment game (n=40) with 90%
      accuracy and find that it also generalizes to a variant of the same task
      collected in a different country with 82% accuracy (n=17). Moreover, we
      establish the convergent and discriminant validity by testing the pattern
      on eleven separate datasets (n=496) and find that trust is reliably
      related to beliefs of safety, inversely related to negative affect, but
      unrelated to reward, cognitive control, social perception, and
      self-referential processing. Together these results provide support for
      the notion that the psychological experience of trust contains elements of
      beliefs of reciprocation and fear of betrayal aversion. Contrary to our
      predictions, we found no evidence that trust is related to anticipated
      reward. This work demonstrates how neurometrics can be used to
      characterize the psychological processes associated with brain-based
      multivariate representations.

    title: Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Livers During NLRP3 Inflammasome
      Activation Reveals a Novel Immune Niche
    category: immunology
    abstract: The NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a central
      contributor to human acute and chronic liver disease, yet the molecular
      and cellular mechanisms by which its activation precipitates injury remain
      incompletely understood. Here, we present single cell transcriptomic
      profiling of livers from a global transgenic Tamoxifen-inducible
      constitutively-activated Nlrp3A350V mutant mouse, and we investigate the
      changes in parenchymal and non-parenchymal liver cell gene expression that
      accompany inflammation and fibrosis. Our results demonstrate that NLRP3
      activation causes chronic extramedullary myelopoiesis marked by an
      increase in proliferating myeloid progenitors that differentiate into
      neutrophils, monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages, results that
      were corroborated by flow cytometry and histological staining. We observed
      prominent neutrophil infiltrates with increased Ly6gHI and Ly6gINT cells
      exhibiting transcriptomic signatures of granulopoiesis typically found in
      the bone marrow. This was accompanied by a marked increase in Ly6cHI
      monocytes differentiating into Cd11bHITim4HIClec-4fHI macrophages that
      express proinflammatory transcriptional programs similar to macrophages of
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) models. NLRP3 activation also
      downregulated metabolic pathways in hepatocytes and shifted hepatic
      stellate cells towards an activated pro-fibrotic state based on expression
      of collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) regulatory genes. These
      results, which highlight abundant neutrophils and extramedullary
      granulopoiesis define an inflamed and fibrotic hepatic single cell
      microenvironment, precipitated solely by NLRP3 activation. Clinically, our
      data support the notion that neutrophils and NLRP3 should be explored as
      therapeutic targets in NASH-like inflammation.

    title: Mechanistic Insights on ATP's role as Hydrotrope
    category: biophysics
    abstract: Hydrotropes are small amphiphilic molecules which help in solubilizing
      hydrophobic entities in aqueous medium. Recent experimental investigation
      has provided convincing evidences that, adenosine triphosphate (ATP),
      besides being an energy currency of cell, also can act as hydrotrope to
      inhibit the formation of protein condensates. In this work, we have
      designed computer simulations of prototypical macromolecules in aqueous
      ATP solution to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying ATP's newly
      discovered role as a hydrotrope. The simulation demonstrates that ATP can
      unfold a single-chain of hydrophobic macromolecule as well as can disrupt
      the aggregation process of a hydrophobic assembly. Moreover, the
      introduction of charges in the macromolecule is found to reinforce ATP's
      disaggregation effects in a synergistic fashion, a behaviour reminiscent
      of recent experimental observation of pronounced hydrotropic action of ATP
      in intrinsically disordered proteins. A molecular analysis indicates that
      this new-found ability of ATP are ingrained in its propensity of
      preferential binding to the polymer surface ,which gets fortified in
      presence of charges. The investigation also renders evidence that the key
      to the ATP's superior hydrotropic role over chemical hydrotrope (Sodium
      xylene sulfonate, NaXS) may lie in its inherent self-aggregation
      propensity. Overall, via employing a bottom-up approach the current
      investigation provides fresh mechanistic insights into the dual
      solubilizing and denaturing abilities of ATP.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Low dose mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine generates durable T cell memory and
      antibodies enhanced by pre-existing crossreactive T cell memory
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Understanding human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccines is of
      interest for a panoply of reasons. Here we examined vaccine-specific CD4+
      T cell, CD8+ T cell, binding antibody, and neutralizing antibody responses
      to the 25 ug Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine over 7 months post-immunization,
      including multiple age groups, with a particular interest in assessing
      whether pre-existing crossreactive T cell memory impacts vaccine-generated
      immunity. Low dose (25 ug) mRNA-1273 elicited durable Spike binding
      antibodies comparable to that of convalescent COVID-19 cases.
      Vaccine-generated Spike memory CD4+ T cells 6 months post-boost were
      comparable in quantity and quality to COVID-19 cases, including the
      presence of TFH cells and IFNg-expressing cells. Spike CD8+ T cells were
      generated in 88% of subjects, with equivalent percentages of CD8+ T cell
      memory responders at 6 months post-boost compared to COVID-19 cases.
      Lastly, subjects with pre-existing crossreactive CD4+ T cell memory had
      increased CD4+ T cell and antibody responses to the vaccine, demonstrating
      a biological relevance of SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive CD4+ T cells.

    title: "Efficacy, safety, and lot to lot immunogenicity of an inactivated
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152): a double-blind, randomised, controlled phase
      3 trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We report the clinical efficacy against COVID 19
      infection of BBV152, a whole virion inactivated SARS CoV 2 vaccine
      formulated with a Toll like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum
      (Algel IMDG). Methods: We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre,
      phase 3 clinical trial in 25 Indian hospitals to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and immunological lot consistency of BBV152. Healthy adults (age
      18 to 98 years) randomised 1:1 using a sponsor-supplied randomisation
      scheme received two intramuscular doses of vaccine or placebo administered
      four weeks apart. The primary outcome was laboratory confirmed symptomatic
      COVID 19, occurring at least 14 days after the second dose. Secondary
      outcomes were efficacy in subgroups for age (18 to < 60 years and >=60
      years) and in participants with pre-existing stable medical conditions. We
      also evaluated safety, reactogenicity, and consistency of immune responses
      for three consecutive manufacturing lots. Findings: Between November 16,
      2020 and January 7, 2021 we recruited 25,798 participants who were
      randomised to BBV152 or placebo groups; 24,419 received two doses of
      BBV152 (n = 12,221) or placebo (n = 12,198). In a case-driven analysis,
      130 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were reported in 16,973 (0.77%)
      participants with follow-up at least two weeks after the second
      vaccination; 24 occurred in the vaccine group and 106 in placebo
      recipients giving an overall vaccine efficacy of 77.8% (95% CI:
      65.2,86.4). Sixteen cases, one vaccinee and 15 placebo recipients, met the
      severe symptomatic COVID-19 case definition giving a vaccine efficacy of
      93.4% (57.1,99.8). Efficacy against asymptomatic COVID 19 was 63.6% (29.0,
      82.4). BBV152 conferred 65.2% (95% CI: 33.1, 83.0) protection against the
      SARS CoV 2 Variant of Concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta). BBV152 was well
      tolerated with no clinically or statistically significant differences in
      the distributions of solicited, unsolicited, or serious adverse events
      between vaccine and placebo groups. No cases of anaphylaxis or
      vaccine-related deaths were reported. Interpretation: BBV152 was
      immunogenic and highly efficacious against symptomatic and asymptomatic
      COVID 19 variant associated disease, particularly against severe disease
      in adults. Vaccination was well tolerated with an overall incidence of
      adverse events observed over a median of 146 days that was lower than that
      observed with other COVID-19 vaccines."

      Not a very significant report. Dr. Fauci has already admitted that COVAXIN
      is very effective against most of the variants.  So, I don't really
      understand what is the point of highlighting it now. If there are any
      irregularities, then hopspital administration should be held responsible
      and not ICMR and Bharat Biotech. Reviewers will definitely ask question on
      the data if they find any inconsistencies.

    title: Can we put Humpty Dumpty back together again? What does protein
      quantification mean in bottom-up proteomics?
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: Bottom-up proteomics provides peptide measurements and has been
      invaluable for moving proteomics into large-scale analyses. In bottom-up
      proteomics, protein parsimony and protein inference derived from these
      measured peptides are important for determining which protein coding genes
      are present. However, given the complexity of RNA splicing processes, and
      how proteins can be modified post-translationally, it is overly simplistic
      to assume that all peptides that map to a singular protein coding gene
      will demonstrate the same quantitative response. Accordingly, by assuming
      all peptides from a protein coding sequence are representative of the same
      protein we may be missing out on detecting important biological
      differences. To better account for the complexity of the proteome we need
      to think of new or better ways of handling peptide data.

      I 100% agree that this is an issue. I think the key observation here is
      that we effectively miss data by not taking this peptide level variance
      into account.


      However there is an issue, I think, when considering data e.g. in Fig 5c where you infer isoforms based upon variance of different peptides across the proteins. IF the different isoforms of that protein (PTMs, processing etc) are known, one can map peptides onto that knowledge. But it's fair to assume, I think that most PTMs or splice forms are not known (currently). 


      In either case (isoforms known or unknown), I think you are assuming that digestion efficiency, and release of each peptide, is equal across samples. We've done studies where we've digested the same pure protein 10x and run SRMs for 15 or so peptides and you clearly observe high levels of variance, so it's clear that, from a quantitative perspective, not all peptides are equal. I *think* for this to work, you need either a predefined set of 'good' peptides (highly reproducible signals in replicate digests of the same sample), or technical replicates on top of biological replicates in each study to be able to determine that peptide-level differences  are down to real peptide-level differences rather than variable digestion kinetics?

    title: "COVID-19 vaccines dampen genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2: Unvaccinated
      patients exhibit more antigenic mutational variance"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Variants of SARS-CoV-2 are evolving under a combination of immune
      selective pressure in infected hosts and natural genetic drift, raising a
      global alarm regarding the durability of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we
      conducted longitudinal analysis over 1.8 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
      183 countries or territories to capture vaccination-associated viral
      evolutionary patterns. To augment this macroscale analysis, we performed
      viral genome sequencing in 23 vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 patients and
      30 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients for whom we also conducted
      machine-augmented curation of the electronic health records (EHRs).
      Strikingly, we find the diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages is declining
      at the country-level with increased rate of mass vaccination (n = 25
      countries, mean correlation coefficient = -0.72, S.D. = 0.20). Given that
      the COVID-19 vaccines leverage B-cell and T-cell epitopes, analysis of
      mutation rates shows neutralizing B-cell epitopes to be particularly more
      mutated than comparable amino acid clusters (4.3-fold, p < 0.001).
      Prospective validation of these macroscale evolutionary patterns using
      clinically annotated SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences confirms that
      vaccine breakthrough patients indeed harbor viruses with significantly
      lower diversity in known B cell epitopes compared to unvaccinated COVID-19
      patients (2.3-fold, 95% C.I. 1.4-3.7). Incidentally, in these study
      cohorts, vaccinated breakthrough patients also displayed fewer
      COVID-associated complications and pre-existing conditions relative to
      unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. This study presents the first known
      evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the
      evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. The
      societal benefit of mass vaccination may consequently go far beyond the
      widely reported mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and amelioration
      of community transmission, to include stemming of rampant viral evolution.

    abstract: The unprecedented rate of extinction calls for efficient use of
      genetics to help conserve biodiversity. Several recent genomic and
      simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation
      biology has placed too much focus on the conservation of genome-wide
      genetic variation, and that this approach should be replaced with another
      that focuses instead on managing the subset of functional genetic
      variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate
      the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We
      find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that the
      conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to
      prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving
      populations towards extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on
      presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible
      occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized
      over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat
      loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental
      effects of lost genome-wide variation on long-term population viability
      will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.

    title: "The World Mortality Dataset: Tracking excess mortality across countries
      during the COVID-19 pandemic"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or
      across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths
      can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess
      mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the
      recent average, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the
      COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no central,
      frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across
      countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or
      quarterly all-cause mortality data from 77 countries, openly available as
      the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to
      compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality
      increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by
      over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID
      mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been
      reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been
      underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more.
      Averaging across the entire dataset suggests that the world's COVID-19
      death toll may be at least 1.6 times higher than the reported number of
      confirmed deaths.

      Dear Sebastian,


      For the % increase estimate, our denominator is *annual* baseline. You can see the weekly/monthly/quartelry baselines for each country here: https://github.com/dkobak/excess-mortality/blob/main/baselines.csv


      Our predicted annual baseline for Germany is 978,953 deaths (as Germany has an upward trend in mortality based on previous 5 years) so 36K excess deaths is 3.7% which is rounded in the table and figure to 4%, as we mention in the text. 


      Generally, for the exact estimated numbers please turn to our publicly open and always updated repo which contains the code/CSV and everything else: https://github.com/dkobak/excess-mortality

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Dynamic rewiring of biological activity across genotype and lineage
      revealed by context-dependent functional interactions
    category: systems-biology
    abstract: Coessentiality networks derived from CRISPR screens in cell lines
      provide a powerful framework for identifying functional modules in the
      cell and for inferring the role of uncharacterized genes. However, these
      networks integrate signal across all underlying data, and can mask strong
      interactions that occur in only a subset of the cell lines analyzed. Here
      we decipher dynamic functional interactions by identifying significant
      cellular contexts, primarily by oncogenic mutation, lineage, and tumor
      type, and discovering coessentiality relationships that depend on these
      contexts. We recapitulate well-known gene-context interactions such as
      oncogene-mutation, paralog buffering, and tissue-specific essential genes,
      show how mutation rewires known signal transduction pathways, including
      RAS/RAF and IGF1R-PIK3CA, and illustrate the implications for drug
      targeting. We further demonstrate how context-dependent functional
      interactions can elucidate lineage-specific gene function, as illustrated
      by the maturation of proreceptors IGF1R and MET by proteases FURIN and
      CPD. This approach advances our understanding of context-dependent
      interactions and how they can be gleaned from these data.

      Cool project!

      I can't seem to find Supplementary Figure 1. Is this also uploaded or will you update this at a later stage?



      I also have a question to the scatter plots you show in the different figures. When you show the coloured linear fit lines: are these the linear fits obtained from the Pearson correlation of all cell lines excluding the context (seems to be the case for e.g. Fig 3 D/E)? Or are these fits obtained when considering only cell lines of that specific context (seeems to be the case for e.g. Fig 4 B-E)?

    title: "AltumAge: A Pan-Tissue DNA-Methylation Epigenetic Clock Based on Deep
      Learning"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Several age predictors based on DNA methylation, dubbed epigenetic
      clocks, have been created in recent years. Their accuracy and potential
      for generalization vary widely based on the training data. Here, we
      gathered 143 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to
      develop AltumAge, a highly accurate and precise age predictor based on
      deep learning. Compared to Horvath's 2013 model, AltumAge performs better
      across both normal and malignant tissues and is more generalizable to new
      data sets. Interestingly, it can predict gestational week from placental
      tissue with low error. Lastly, we used deep learning interpretation
      methods to learn which methylation sites contributed to the final model
      predictions. We observed that while most important CpG sites are linearly
      related to age, some highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the
      relevance of such relationships. We studied the associated genes of these
      CpG sites and found literary evidence of their involvement in age-related
      gene regulation. Using chromatin annotations, we observed that the CpG
      sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions were related
      to heterochromatin and gene regulatory regions in the genome. We also
      found age-related KEGG pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. In
      general, neural networks are better predictors due to their ability to
      capture complex feature interactions compared to the typically used
      regularized linear regression. Altogether, our neural network approach
      provides significant improvement and flexibility to current epigenetic
      clocks without sacrificing model interpretability.

    title: Association between erythrocyte dynamics and vessel remodelling in
      developmental vascular networks
    category: developmental-biology
    abstract: >-
      Sprouting angiogenesis is an essential vascularisation mechanism
      consisting of sprouting and remodelling. The remodelling phase is driven
      by rearrangements of endothelial cells (ECs) within the post-sprouting
      vascular plexus. Prior work has uncovered how ECs polarise and migrate in
      response to flow-induced wall shear stress (WSS). However, the question of
      how the presence of erythrocytes (well-known as RBCs) and their
      haemodynamics impact affects vascular remodelling remains unanswered.
      Here, we devise a computational framework to model cellular blood flow in
      developmental mouse retina. We demonstrate a previously unreported highly
      heterogeneous distribution of RBCs in primitive vasculature. Furthermore,
      we report a strong association between vessel regression and RBC
      depletion, and identify plasma skimming as the driving mechanism. Live
      imaging in a developmental zebrafish model confirms this association.
      Taken together, our results indicate that RBC dynamics are fundamental to
      establishing the regional WSS differences driving vascular remodelling via
      their ability to modulate effective viscosity.


      SummaryRecent studies demonstrate that during sprouting angiogenesis, blood flow provides crucial hydrodynamic cues (e.g. wall shear stress) for the remodelling of primitive plexuses towards a functional network. Notwithstanding, the role of RBCs in this process remains poorly understood. We report on the inherent heterogeneity of RBC perfusion within primitive vasculatures, and uncover a strong association between RBC depletion and vessel regression. Our work indicates the essential role of RBC dynamics in the establishment of regional WSS differences driving vascular remodelling. The RBC-driven process of pruning cell-depleted vessels not only importantly contributes to the optimal patterning of vascular networks during development, but also provides a remodelling mechanism to support clinical findings of microangiopathic complications associated with impaired RBC deformability in diseases such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.

    title: Incorrect Molecular Weights due to inaccurate Prestained Protein
      Molecular Weight Markers that are used for Gel Electrophoresis and Western
      Blotting
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: The most widely used Western blotting protein standards are prestained
      proteins of known molecular mass (kDa). They are also utilized for sodium
      dodecyl sulphate (SDS) Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) to
      determine the molecular mass of proteins separated by electrophoresis. The
      objective of this study was to assess the reliability of different
      commercially available protein standards in predicting accurate protein
      molecular weights. We performed this experiment by running Criterion TGX
      gels with five prestained protein standards (Thermo Fisher SeeBlue Plus 2,
      Bio-Rad Precision Plus Protein Dual-color, Thermo Fisher Spectra
      Multi-color, Novex-Sharp Pre-stained, and Invitrogen iBright Pre-Stained).
      To evaluate their accuracy, we utilized highly purified Bovine Serum
      Albumin (BSA, 66.44 kDa) and Cytochrome C (Cyto C, 11.62 kDa). We also
      made use of the dimers of BSA (132.88 kDa) and Cyt C (23.24 kDa) that are
      present on SDS-PAGE gels. Our results suggest that three of the standards
      were less accurate at higher molecular masses with the iBright marker
      having the highest error in determining the expected 132.88 kDa molecular
      weight. The SeeBlue Plus 2 was accurate at identifying the 132.88 kDa
      molecular weight protein band but was less reliable for the three other
      lower molecular weight proteins. These findings have significant
      implications for the determination of protein masses because researchers
      rely on these standards to evaluate the molecular masses of their
      protein(s). We suggest that at least two different protein standards
      should be initially used in electrophoresis gels and for Western blotting
      in order to get accurate protein molecular weight results.

      Dear authors,


      Thank you very much for your scientific work on assessing the reliability of molecular weight (MW) markers in SDS-PAGE. The findings of your study are highly relevant for researchers using this methodology for analyzing proteins. Also, in our lab, where we are using different MW markers, we have experienced variations and discrepancies. In your work, you have tested all MW markers on TGX pre-cast gels. We preferentially use Bis-Tris and Tris-acetate gels, and we see differences between the MW prediction precision divergent from your results. Did you consider expanding your dataset using more gel types as the earlier mentioned BT and TA gels? 


      I look forward to your reply.


      Best regards,

      Jonasz Weber

    title: Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to eight months after
      infection
    category: immunology
    abstract: Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving
      diagnostics and vaccines, and for assessing the likely future course of
      the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating
      immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases,
      including 43 samples at [&ge;] 6 months post-infection. IgG to the Spike
      protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B
      cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month post symptom onset.
      SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a
      half-life of 3-5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell,
      and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed
      that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct
      kinetics.

      BackgroundSevere coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests as a
      life-threatening microvascular syndrome. The severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S)
      protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. To date, it is
      still not known if the S protein alone, without the other viral elements,
      is able to trigger vascular cell signalling and provoke cell dysfunction.


      MethodsWe investigated the effects of the recombinant, stabilised S protein on primary human cardiac pericytes (PCs) signalling and function. Endpoints included cell viability, proliferation, migration, cooperation with endothelial cells (ECs) in angiogenesis assays, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Adopting a blocking strategy against the S protein receptors ACE2 and CD147, we explored which receptor mediates the S protein signalling in PCs.


      FindingsWe show, for the first time, that the recombinant S protein alone elicits functional alterations in cardiac PCs. This was documented as: (1) increased migration, (2) reduced ability to support EC network formation on Matrigel, (3) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules typically involved in the cytokine storm, and (4) production of pro-apoptotic factors responsible for EC death. Furthermore, the S protein stimulates the phosphorylation/activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through the CD147 receptor, but not ACE2, in cardiac PCs. Accordingly, the neutralization of CD147, using a blocking antibody, prevented the activation of ERK1/2 and partially rescued the PC function in the presence of the S protein.


      InterpretationOur findings suggest the new, intriguing hypothesis that the S protein may elicit vascular cell dysfunction, potentially amplifying, or perpetuating, the damage caused by the whole coronavirus. This mechanism may have clinical and therapeutic implication.

      Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses primarily the capsid spike (S) protein to engage with its receptors and infect host cells. Co-receptors and host cell proteases may also be involved. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the well-recognized entry receptor used by the virus in respiratory epithelial cells; it is also abundantly expressed in the human heart. Alongside ACE2, CD147 has recently emerged as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, it is not clear if SARS-CoV-2 triggers adverse responses in cardiac vascular mural cells. Likewise, no investigation was devoted to verifying if the recombinant S protein alone can mimic the whole virus signalling.


      Added value of this studyThis study provides the first evidence that the recombinant S protein alone, without the other viral elements, is capable of eliciting cellular signalling in human cardiac pericytes, thereby inducing cell dysfunction. In addition, this study proposes CD147 as the leading receptor mediating S protein signalling in cardiac pericytes.


      Implications of all the available evidenceThese reports imply that fragments of the S protein might be able to elicit vascular cell dysfunction. Blocking the CD147 receptor may help protect the vasculature not only from infection, but also from the collateral damage caused by the S protein.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      Hello Scott and thanks for taking the time to post your concerns and
      thoughts.


      Actually, over 87% were prescribed HCQ. In other posts, I explain in several ways why cumulative HCQ dose is not simply a marker of survival. The cumulative HCQ dose was based upon the ID doc seeing the pts. Different ID docs interpreted the available data differently. 

      The most commonly used dose = 2,400 mg over 5 days. 

      Please see the other posts for details. 

      And, I have tried very hard to explain why HCQ cumulative dose isn't a marker of survival. 


      Thanks,

      Stephen

      Hello Semper and thanks for taking the time to post your concerns.


      I will address your questions in reverse order. 

      First, the VA Study included anyone, who had a pill of HCQ dispensed to them, in the HCQ arm. That means if a pt got 1 pill or 60 pills of HCQ, that pt was in the HCQ arm. That's not medically sound. Second, none of the VA Study's authors treated a single pt with Covid. That's very important. When clinical data are being analyzed by statisticians, a clinician needs to able to explain what this means and that means. I am unsure what the motivation was for basic science ophthalmologists to do a Covid study. 

      Second, we looked at all medications given, esp. steroids, toci and CP. We looked antibiotics in general and by potency. AZM alone was not associated in an increase in survival. In reviewing the >3 g HCQ/>1 g AZM group, we, of course, went through their other therapies to see if something else could explain this large difference in survival. BTW, we didn't see much secondary bacterial pneumonia in Covid pts. We expected to. That's how influenza often or usually kills people. Diagnosing secondary bacterial pneumonia in intubated pts isn't easy. That's one of the reasons we looked at antibiotics, to see if empiric antibiotic therapy for secondary bacterial pneumonia improved outcomes. As best we could tell, it did not. 

      Third, the mortality rates of similar studies were similar to this cohorts mortality rate. Early reports used short data collection periods, such as 14 days or time to discharge from the ICU. Those earlier reports had large percentages of pts still in the hospital and on the ventilator. So, the mortality rates were underestimated, as they noted that in their discussion sections. I cited references, which looked at longer times after admission and had similar mortality rates after IMV. 

      Fourth, I don't understand your criticism about the statistics. A p-value means the chance the difference between the two groups is due to chance. A p-value = 0.05 means there is a 5% chance the observed difference is due to random chance. The lower the p-value, the less likely the difference is secondary to chance. These p-values were often well below 0.05, the arbitrary cut-off for scientific significance. These statistics were performed by professionals. In fact, we used more than one statistics group to make sure they agreed and they did. 

      Fifth, the study doesn't show HCQ improves survival. The data show that HCQ and AZM given together and both above a certain threshold are very strongly associated or cause improvement in survival even after controlling for other factors. The HCQ RCTs I am aware of only reported ITT analyses of the data, meaning they did not report Per Protocol analyses. The only inpatient HCQ/AZM RCT was done in Brazil. In this study, the mortality rate in each group, including the control group mortality, was very low, they only enrolled pts who had <= 4L NC and 24% of subjects had a negative Covid test or none available. The data from this study do not apply to this Cohort, over 95% tested Covid+ and all required intubation and mechanical ventilation. 

      Sixth, I prefer good RCT data to good observational data. The restrictions of observational data are known and discussed. However, many RCTs have serious flaws. Usually, where the RCT data differ from the observational data, the RCT data are correct, but not always. Regardless, there exists no RCT which looked at HCQ/AZM therapy in IMV-requiring Covid pts.

      Since the beginning of Medicine, observational data have been very helpful in many settings. As mentioned, the HCQ RCTs didn't even report PP analysis. Perhaps, there is no dose-response from HCQ in Covid, but the studies I have read didn't look at cumulative dose. 

      From an historic perspective, many current, first-line therapies and many FDA approved drugs lack RCT data. Of course, RCTs are not always so R. In many instances, the randomization process can be or is affected by someone/something. It wasn't an RCT, but was expanded use. I had an AIDS pts many yrs ago. The pt was dying. The pt had several, active opportunistic infections. We had participated in the RCT and knew the expanded access protocol. If I were honest about the pt's clinical situation, the company running the expanded access would not have given the pt the drug. I also knew the drug worked, and it was awaiting FDA approval based on the published RCT data. 

      I did the only ethical thing I could do; I lied. The pt got the drug and the recovery was miraculous. Last I checked, the pt was still doing well. 

      Doctors are notorious liars, when it comes to helping their pts. So, even well meaning doctors can screw up an RCT. Or, the analyses can be done in a way to confuse the results. Or the protocols are not adhered to as they should be. Take the Brazil RCT, 24% had a negative Covid test or did not have one available. Why did they include those pts? It's one thing if you have positive results, but if the results are negative, you need to do everything you can to make sure the enrolled pts have the disease you are testing. 


      Thanks,

      Stephen

    title: Social inequalities in hostility toward vaccination against Covid-19
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: In recent decades, France has appeared as a country particularly
      hostile to vaccination in general. When asked in November 2020 about the
      intention to take the Covid-19 vaccine, the French public showed, once
      again, reluctance. Therefore, France appeared as an ideal case study to
      analyze whether the hostility toward the Covid-19 vaccine has its own
      reasons or whether it is related to the reluctance to the principle of
      vaccination itself. Our objective was to determine the specificity of the
      social determinants of the intention to get the Covid-19 vaccine. Thanks
      to the use of a large random sample of the general population in France
      (86,000 individuals), the reluctant to Covid-19 vaccine could be clearly
      distinguished from the hesitant and the convinced, and thereby thoroughly
      analyzed. Our analysis highlighted a gendered reluctance toward
      vaccination in general but even more so regarding vaccination against
      Covid-19. It might refer to women being more concerned about the possible
      effects of an injection in their body, especially at the age of maternity
      and a differentiated socialization making them more sensitive than men to
      long-term risks and more apprehensive toward rapid technological change.
      We also found that people at the bottom of the social hierarchy, in terms
      of level of education, financial resources, and immigration status, were
      more likely to refuse the Covid-19 vaccine. Nevertheless, this reluctance
      was less prominent than for vaccination in general, reflecting the actual
      spread of the epidemic in various social milieux. Finally, our analysis
      showed that trust in the government's actions was significantly associated
      with reluctance toward the Covid-19 vaccine, even more than toward
      vaccination in general. Specific campaigns should be thought beforehand to
      reach women and people at the bottom of the social hierarchy to avoid
      furthering social inequalities in terms of morbidity and mortality.

      Another possible interpretation for hesitation/reluctance to get
      vaccinated could be that people who did not get Covid do not see the
      interest of getting vaccinated since they managed to avoid Covid by using
      masks, washing hands, etc. This could be even more relevant for workers
      who attended their work as usual during the three lockdowns. It could be
      worth to look into this if you have access to these information.


      Other interpretation: poorer people tend to travel less frequently and may have less interest in the vaccine since it is not mandatory for conducting daily activities.

    title: Risk factors for intensive care admission and death amongst children and
      young people admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and PIMS-TS in England
      during the first pandemic year
    category: pediatrics
    abstract: Identifying which children and young people (CYP) are vulnerable to
      severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 is important to guide shielding and
      vaccination policy. Methods We used data for all inpatient hospital
      admissions in England in CYP aged 0-17 between March 1st 2015 to Feb 28th
      2021, linked to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, and
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and deaths. We calculated odds ratios and
      predicted probability of PICU admission using generalized estimation
      equations, and compared these between COVID-19, PIMS-TS, other admissions
      in 2020/21, all admissions in 2019/20, and admissions due to influenza in
      20219/20. Findings There were 6,338 COVID-19 hospitalisations, 259 PICU
      admissions and 8 deaths as well as 712 PIMS-TS hospitalisations, 312 PICU
      admissions and <5 deaths. Odds of PICU admission were increased amongst
      neonates and decreased amongst 15-17 compared with 1-4 year olds with
      COVID-19, increased in older CYP and females with PIMS-TS, and increased
      for Black compared with White ethnicity for both conditions. Odds of PICU
      admission with COVID-19 were increased for CYP with any comorbidity and
      were highest for CYP with multiple medical problems. Comorbidities
      associated with PICU admission among COVID-19 patients were similar to
      overall PICU admissions in 2019/20 and to influenza PICU admissions in
      2019/20, but with higher odds. Interpreting associations with
      comorbidities within PIMS-TS was complex due to the multisystem nature of
      the disease. Interpretation CYP were at very low risk of severe disease
      and death from COVID-19 or PIMS-TS. Patterns of vulnerability for severe
      COVID-19 appear to magnify background risk factors for serious illness in
      CYP.

    title: Extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination enhances peak antibody generation
      in older people
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: To assess the relative immunogenicity of
      standard or extended interval BNT162b2 vaccination. Design: Population
      based cohort study comparing immune responses 2 weeks after the second
      vaccine, with appropriate time-matched samples in participants who
      received standard or extended interval double vaccination. Setting:
      Primary care networks, Birmingham, UK. December 2020 to April 2021.
      Participants: 175 people aged over 80 years of age. All donors received
      the BNT162b2 Pfizer/BioNTech vaccination and were vaccinated with either a
      standard 3 week interval between doses or an extended interval schedule.
      Main outcome measures: Peak quantitative spike-specific antibody and
      cellular immune responses. Results: In donors without evidence of previous
      infection the peak antibody response was 3.5-fold higher in donors who had
      undergone delayed interval vaccination. Cellular immune responses were
      3.6-fold lower. Conclusion: Peak antibody responses after the second
      BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly enhanced in older people when this is
      delayed to 12 weeks although cellular responses are lower. Extended
      interval vaccination may therefore offer the potential to enhance and
      extend humoral immunity. Further follow up is now required to assess long
      term immunity and clinical protection."

      So is there a study that backs up 6 or 8 weeks for young and middle aged
      adults?


      In Germany, the recommendation until last week was to hit exactly six weeks to stay within EMA licence but spread out the vaccine. Now, with more vaccine available and Delta looming, the allow 3 - 6 weeks but without any recommendation as to which end of that window to prefer. 


      EMA recommends 19 - 23 days but their reasoning is that 93% of trial participants fell into that bracket. So maybe they have simply no data to say that six weeks are better?


      Unlike with the AZ vaccine, there is no vector immunity to overcome so it is not clear why a longer interval should be better.


      Back to those seniors in this study here, is it even good for them to have more antibodies and less T-cells? My understanding is that they are typically T-cell challenged, so is it not better to boost T-cells?

    title: The molecular appearance of native TRPM7 channel complexes identified by
      high-resolution proteomics
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: The transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7)
      is a ubiquitously expressed membrane protein consisting of ion channel and
      protein kinase domains. TRPM7 plays a fundamental role in the cellular
      uptake of divalent cations such as Zn2+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, and thus shapes
      cellular excitability, plasticity and metabolic activity. The molecular
      appearance and operation of TRPM7 channel complexes in native tissues have
      remained unresolved. Here, we investigated the subunit composition of
      endogenous TRPM7 channels in rodent brain by multi-epitope affinity
      purification and high-resolution quantitative MS analysis. We found that
      native TRPM7 channels are high molecular-weight multi-protein complexes
      that contain the putative metal transporter proteins CNNM1-4 and a small
      G-protein ARL15. Heterologous reconstitution experiments confirmed the
      formation of TRPM7/CNNM/ARL15 ternary complexes and indicated that ARL15
      effectively and specifically impacts TRPM7 channel activity. These results
      open up new avenues towards a mechanistic understanding of the cellular
      regulation and function of TRPM7 channels.

    abstract: Precise Hox gene expression is crucial for embryonic patterning.
      Intra-Hox transcription factor binding and distal enhancer elements have
      emerged as the major regulatory modes controlling Hox gene expression.
      However, quantifying their relative contributions has remained elusive.
      Here, we introduce 'synthetic regulatory reconstitution', a novel
      conceptual framework for studying gene regulation and apply it to the HoxA
      cluster. We synthesized and delivered variant rat HoxA clusters (130-170
      kilobases each) to an ectopic location in the mouse genome. We find that a
      HoxA cluster lacking distal enhancers recapitulates correct patterns of
      chromatin remodeling and transcription in response to patterning signals,
      while distal enhancers are required for full transcriptional output.
      Synthetic regulatory reconstitution is a generalizable strategy to
      decipher the regulatory logic of gene expression in complex genomes.

    title: "Fly Cell Atlas: a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult fruit fly"
    category: genomics
    abstract: The ability to obtain single cell transcriptomes for stable cell types
      and dynamic cell states is ushering in a new era for biology. We created
      the Tabula Drosophilae, a single cell atlas of the adult fruit fly which
      includes 580k cells from 15 individually dissected sexed tissues as well
      as the entire head and body. Over 100 researchers from the fly community
      contributed annotations to >250 distinct cell types across all tissues. We
      provide an in-depth analysis of cell type-related gene signatures and
      transcription factor markers, as well as sexual dimorphism, across the
      whole animal. Analysis of common cell types that are shared between
      tissues, such as blood and muscle cells, allowed the discovery of rare
      cell types and tissue-specific subtypes. This atlas provides a valuable
      resource for the entire Drosophila community and serves as a comprehensive
      reference to study genetic perturbations and disease models at single-cell
      resolution.

      <blockquote>For example, in the fat body (fig. S16), the main fat body
      cells formed one big cluster, but our metabolic pathway enrichment
      analysis performed through ASAP (David et al., 2020) revealed that fatty
      acid biosynthesis and degradation are in fact compartmentalized,
      highlighting possible fat body cell heterogeneity in terms of metabolic
      capacities.</blockquote>


      This is a really interesting observation. We saw the same thing in our preprint posted a few months ago, and the heterogeneity was stable in biologically replicated samples across multiple treatments (factorial design of mated, unmated, bacterially infected, uninfected). 


      We discussed some specific clusters and their apparent functional enrichment based on the expression data:


      <blockquote>GO enrichment analysis of differentially regulated genes in each of the six subpopulations showed enrichment for diverse functions (Table S3). Upregulated genes in both Clusters 0 and 1 were enriched for one-carbon metabolism but mediated by two different mechanisms: s-adenosyl methionine (SAM; Cluster 0) and folate (Cluster 1). Cluster 1 also showed enriched upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, which were downregulated in Cluster 2. Upregulated genes in Cluster 2 showed enrichment for amino acid biosynthesis. We identified metabolic and detoxification pathways enriched in genes upregulated in Cluster 5, and upregulated genes in both Clusters 7 and 10 were related to phospholipase A1 activity. Therefore, while all six fat body subpopulations respond to mating stimulus, their heterogeneous response suggests subfunctionalization of the cellular populations.</blockquote>

      Is this similar to the heterogeneity you see in the present analysis of the fat body?

    title: "Knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Population-level
      estimation and a comparison of data obtained by phone and online survey
      methods"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Adherence of people to the guidelines and measures suggested in
      fighting the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is partly determined by the
      Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP) of the population. In this
      cross-sectional study, we primarily addressed two key issues. First, we
      tried to determine whether there is a significant difference in the
      estimated COVID-19 knowledge level from the online and phone survey
      methods. Second, we tried to quantify the knowledge and attitude of
      COVID-19 in Bangladeshi adult population. Data were collected through
      phone calls (April 14-23, 2020) and online survey (April 18-19, 2020) in
      Bangladesh. The questionnaire had 20 knowledge questions with each correct
      response getting one point and incorrect/do not know response getting no
      point (maximum total knowledge score 20). Participants scoring >17 were
      categorized as having good knowledge. The percentages of good knowledge
      holders were 57.6%, 75.1%, and 95.8% in the phone (n=1426), online
      non-medical (n=1097), and online medical participants (n=382),
      respectively. Comparison between phone and online survey showed that,
      overall, online survey might overestimate knowledge level than that of
      phone survey, although there was no difference for elderly, poor, and
      rural people. Male gender, higher education, living in town/urban areas,
      good financial condition, and use of internet were positively associated
      with good knowledge. However, higher knowledge was associated with having
      less confidence in the final control of COVID-19. Our adult
      population-level estimates showed that only 32.6% (95% CI 30.1-35.2%) had
      good knowledge. This study provides crucial information that could be
      useful for the researchers and policymakers to develop effective
      strategies.

    title: Effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccines for Preventing Covid-19
      Hospitalizations in the United States
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: As SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage increases in the
      United States (US), there is a need to understand the real-world
      effectiveness against severe Covid-19 and among people at increased risk
      for poor outcomes. Methods: In a multicenter case-control analysis of US
      adults hospitalized March 11 through May 5, 2021, we evaluated vaccine
      effectiveness to prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations by comparing odds of
      prior vaccination with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna)
      between cases hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who
      tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Among 1210 participants, median
      age was 58 years, 22.8% were Black, 13.8% were Hispanic, and 20.6% had
      immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was most common variant
      (59.7% of sequenced viruses). Full vaccination (receipt of two vaccine
      doses at least 14 days before illness onset) had been received by 45/590
      (7.6%) cases and 215/620 (34.7%) controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness
      was 86.9% (95% CI: 80.4 to 91.2%). Vaccine effectiveness was similar for
      Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and highest in adults aged 18-49
      years (97.3%; 95% CI: 78.9 to 99.7%). Among 45 patients with
      vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations, 44 (97.8%) were at least 50
      years old and 20 (44.4%) had immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was
      lower among patients with immunosuppression (59.2%; 95% CI: 11.9 to 81.1%)
      than without immunosuppression (91.3%; 95% CI: 85.5 to 94.7%). Conclusion:
      During March through May 2021, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were highly
      effective for preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations among US adults.
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was beneficial for patients with immunosuppression,
      but effectiveness was lower in the immunosuppressed population."

    title: UV-A and UV-B Can Neutralize SARS-CoV-2 Infectivity
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "We performed an in-depth analysis of the virucidal effect of discrete
      wavelengths: UV-C (278 nm), UV-B (308 nm), UV-A (366 nm) and violet (405
      nm) on SARS-CoV-2. By using a highly infectious titer of SARS-CoV-2 we
      observed that the violet light-dose resulting in a 2-log viral
      inactivation is only 10-4 times less efficient than UV-C light. Moreover,
      by qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach we verified
      that the viral titer typically found in the sputum of COVID-19 patients
      can be completely inactivated by the long UV-wavelengths corresponding to
      UV- A and UV-B solar irradiation. The comparison of the UV action spectrum
      on SARS-CoV-2 to previous results obtained on other pathogens suggests
      that RNA viruses might be particularly sensitive to long UV wavelengths.
      Our data extend previous results showing that SARS-CoV-2 is highly
      susceptible to UV light and offer an explanation to the reduced incidence
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection seen in the summer season."

    title: Maori and Pacific People in New Zealand have higher risk of
      hospitalisation for COVID-19
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Aims. We aim to quantify differences in clinical outcomes from
      COVID-19 infection in Aotearoa New Zealand by ethnicity with a focus on
      risk of hospitalisation. Methods. We used data on age, ethnicity,
      deprivation index, pre-existing health conditions, and clinical outcomes
      on 1,829 COVID-19 cases reported in New Zealand. We used a logistic
      regression model to calculate odds ratios for the risk of hospitalisation
      by ethnicity. We also consider length of hospital stay and risk of
      fatality. Results. M[a]ori have 2.50 times greater odds of hospitalisation
      (95% CI 1.39 - 4.51) than non-M[a]ori, non-Pacific people, after
      controlling for age and pre-existing conditions. Pacific people have 3
      times greater odds (95% CI 1.75 - 5.33). Conclusions. Structural
      inequities and systemic racism in the healthcare system mean that M[a]ori
      and Pacific communities face a much greater health burden from COVID-19.
      Older people and those with pre-existing health conditions are also at
      greater risk. This should inform future policy decisions including
      prioritising groups for vaccination.

    title: NEU1 and NEU3 enzymes alter CD22 organization on B cells
    category: immunology
    abstract: The B cell membrane expresses sialic acid binding Immunoglobulin-like
      lectins, also called Siglecs, that are important for modulating immune
      response. Siglecs have interactions with sialoglycoproteins found on the
      same membrane (cis ligands) that result in homotypic and heterotypic
      receptor clusters. The regulation and organization of these clusters, and
      their effect on cell activation, is not clearly understood. We
      investigated the role of human neuraminidase enzymes, NEU1 and NEU3, on
      the clustering of CD22 on B cells using confocal microscopy. We observed
      that native NEU1 and NEU3 activity influence the cluster size of CD22.
      Using single-particle tracking, we observed that NEU3 activity increased
      the lateral mobility of CD22, which was in contrast to the effect of
      exogenous bacterial NEU enzymes. Moreover, we show that native NEU1 and
      NEU3 activity influenced cellular Ca2+ levels, supporting a role for these
      enzymes in regulating B cell activation. Our results establish a role for
      native NEU activity in modulating CD22 organization and function on B
      cells.

    title: Multi-centre post-implementation evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-based
      point of care tests used for asymptomatic screening of continuing care
      healthcare workers
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Frequent screening of SARS-CoV-2 among asymptomatic populations using
      antigen-based point of care tests (APOCT) is occurring globally with
      limited clinical performance data. The positive predictive value (PPV) of
      two APOCT used in the asymptomatic screening of SARS-CoV-2 among
      healthcare workers (HCW) at continuing care (CC) sites across Alberta,
      Canada was evaluated. Between February 22 and May 2, 2021, CC sites
      implemented SARS-CoV-2 voluntary screening of their asymptomatic HCW.
      Onsite testing with Abbott Panbio or BD Veritor occurred on a weekly or
      twice weekly basis. Positive APOCT were confirmed with a real-time
      reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) reference
      method. A total of 71,847 APOCT (17,689 Veritor and 54,158 Panbio) were
      performed among 369 CC sites. Eighty-seven (0.12%) APOCT were positive, of
      which 39 (0.05%) confirmed as true positives using rRT-PCR. Use of the
      Veritor and Panbio resulted in a 76.6% and 30.0% false positive detection,
      respectively (p<0.001). This corresponded to a 23.4% and 70.0% PPV for the
      Veritor and Panbio, respectively. Frequent screening of SARS-CoV-2 among
      asymptomatic HCW in CC, using APOCT, resulted in a very low detection rate
      and a high detection of false positives. Careful assessment between the
      risks vs benefits of APOCT programs in this population needs to be
      thoroughly considered before implementation.

      The authors have misrepresented the use of biostatistics. In line 99 they
      state that APOCT have poor specificity. The authors cannot comment on
      specificity because they do not know the number of true negatives (line
      156-7). However, the prevalence is so low that using the [total number of
      tests – known PCR positives] approximates the true negatives. The
      approximate specificity in this study would be 71768/71808 = 99.94%. This
      is an incredibly high specificity, not poor.

      In lines 106-107, the authors ask us to consider the negative impact of a false positive result, without putting it in context. Every HCW with a positive APOCT had confirmatory PCR. The authors do not state the interval between the two tests; the impact was likely over a period of two days. Moreover, the authors do not consider the alternative scenario, which would be two days of HCW exposures to other HCWs and patients in a HC setting, while waiting for the PCR results. If 39 HCWs were identified with COVID-19, immediately put on isolation (due to 15-minute APOCT), what value did that have for the healthcare system, and for all of their HC and personal contacts? And was that protective value greater than the collective harm caused by identifying 48 HCWs as positive by APOCT who were released from isolation two days later when the PCR result was known?

      “False detection rate” is not a terminology of biosciences and was not defined by the authors. In fact, they are presenting [1-PPV]; which seems pointless since they also present PPV in the next sentence.

      When prevalence is very low, 5 per 10,000 in this study, a slight difference in prevalence can greatly influence PPV. The reason is that false positives tend be fairly static and not influenced by prevalence, but true positives are directly influenced by prevalence. It is wrong to say that APOCTs have a low PPV, unless the sentence includes the prevalence. 

      Because the two tests were not conducted on the same subjects, it is wrong to publish results that represent a head to head comparison. In such a case, the authors were required to use more sophisticated Bayesian statistics, in order to apply a ‘penalty’ or adjustment to account for possible differences due to the differences between the two different populations and the two different test workflows.  

      The authors fail to describe in Methods that one test was visually-read and the other test was read by an analyzer device, and to point out that human variation in ‘reading’ lines on the visually-read test could contribute to the differences. 

      The authors fail to acknowledge that they do not know the numbers of cases of APOCT negative and PCR-positive (false negatives) for each of the two tests; it is possible that one test has a much lower sensitivity and that would need to be considered in context with the false positives and prevalence.

      Finally, the authors did not take the opportunity to discuss what the reasonable prevalence level is for APOCT. In their study, prevalence was 0.05% or 5/10,000. They do not discuss whether it is reasonable to test asymptomatic HCWs at this prevalence level or lower. They do not discuss whether it is reasonable to test asymptomatic non-HCWs at this prevalence level or lower.

    abstract: Background SARS-CoV-2 infections have resulted in a global pandemic,
      but an antiviral therapy for this novel strain of coronavirus does not
      currently exist. The objective of our study was to investigate the
      antiviral potential of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACHR)
      agonist varenicline tartrate against SARS-CoV-2. Methods We assessed
      antiviral activity using in vitro human cell assays and we assessed in
      vivo efficacy in a rhesus macaque model. Results In vitro studies found
      that varenicline tartrate, over a range of concentrations, reduced the
      infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype, alpha, and beta variants in Calu-3
      cells and Caco-2 cells, with maintenance of cell viability. In vivo
      studies found that varenicline tartrate, administered as a nasal spray to
      rhesus macaques, reduced SARS-CoV-2 wildtype viral load and inhibited
      viral replication in the nasal mucosa and upper airway. Conclusion
      Although the study reported here was exploratory, we have confirmed that
      the nAChR agonist varenicline has the potential to interact with and
      inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication.

    title: "Long-chain polyphosphates impair SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication: a
      route for therapy in man"
    category: genetics
    abstract: >-
      Antiviral activities of long chain inorganic polyphosphates (PolyPs)
      against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV2 infection
      were investigated. In molecular docking analyses, PolyPs interacted with
      several conserved angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 and RNA-dependent
      RNA polymerase (RdRp) amino acids. We thus tested PolyPs for functional
      interactions in vitro in SARS CoV2 infected Vero E6, Caco2 and human
      primary nasal epithelial cells. Immunofluorescence, qPCR, direct RNA
      sequencing, FISH and Immunoblotting were used to determine virus loads and
      transcription levels of genomic(g)RNAs and subgenomic(sg)RNAs. We show
      that PolyP120 binds to ACE2 and enhances its proteasomal degradation.
      PolyP120 shows steric hindrance of the genomic SARS CoV2 RNA/RdRP complex,
      to impair synthesis of positive-sense gRNAs, viral subgenomic transcripts
      and structural proteins needed for viral replication. Thus, PolyP120
      impairs infection and replication of Korean and European (containing non
      synonymous variants) SARS CoV2 strains. As PolyPs have no toxic
      activities, we envision their use as a nebulised formula for oropharyngeal
      delivery to prevent infections of SARS CoV2 and during early phases of
      antiviral therapy

    abstract: >-
      The occurrence of linear cholesterol-recognition motifs in alpha-helical
      transmembrane domains has long been debated. Here, we demonstrate the
      ability of a genetic algorithm guided by coarse-grained molecular dynamics
      simulations--a method coined evolutionary molecular dynamics (evo-MD)--to
      directly resolve the sequence which maximally attracts/sorts cholesterol
      within a single-pass alpha-helical transmembrane domain (TMDs). We
      illustrate that the evolutionary landscape of cholesterol attraction in
      membrane proteins is characterized by a sharp, well-defined global
      optimum. Surprisingly, this optimal solution features an unusual short
      hydrophobic block, consisting of typically only eight short chain
      hydrophobic amino acids, surrounded by three successive lysines. Owing to
      the membrane thickening effect of cholesterol, cholesterol-enriched
      ordered phases favor TMDs characterized by a long rather than a short
      hydrophobic length. However, this short hydrophobic pattern evidently
      offers a pronounced net advantage for the binding of free cholesterol in
      both coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. Attraction is mediated by
      the unique ability of cholesterol to snorkel within the hydrophobic core
      of the membrane and thereby shield deeply located lysines from the
      unfavorable hydrophobic surrounding. Since this mechanism of attraction is
      of a thermodynamic nature and is not based on molecular shape specificity,
      a large diversity of sub-optimal cholesterol attracting sequences can
      exist. The puzzling sequence variability of proposed linear
      cholesterol-recognition motifs is thus consistent with sub-optimal,
      unspecific binding of cholesterol. Importantly, since evo-MD uniquely
      enables the targeted design of recognition motifs for distinct fluid lipid
      membranes, we foresee wide applications for evo-MD in the biological and
      biomedical fields.


      Significance StatementOur work demonstrates how a synergy between evolutionary algorithms and high-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics can yield fundamentally new insights into the evolutionary fingerprints of protein-mediated lipid sorting. We illustrate that the evolutionary landscape of cholesterol attraction in isolated transmembrane domains is characterized by a sharp, well-defined global optimum. In contrast, sub-optimal attraction of cholesterol is associated with a diverse solution space and features a high sequence variability despite binding the same unique molecule. The contrasting physicochemical nature of the resolved attraction optimum suggests that cholesterol attraction/binding via linear motifs does not pose a dominant pressure/constrain on the evolution of transmembrane proteins.

    title: Progressive Increase in Virulence of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants in
      Ontario, Canada, February to June, 2021
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "The period from February to June 2021 was one during which initial
      wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, first by
      variants of concern (VOC) with the N501Y mutation (principally alpha, beta
      and gamma variants), and then by the delta variant. We demonstrate that
      these emerging VOCs were associated with an increase in virulence, as
      measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and
      death. Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, and adjusting for
      comorbidity, age and sex of cases, and temporal trends, the elevation in
      risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 74% (62-86%) for
      hospitalization; 138% (105-176%) for ICU admission; and 83% (57-114%) for
      death. Increases with delta variant were even larger: 105% (80-133%) for
      hospitalization; 241% (163-344%) for ICU admission; and 121% (57-211%) for
      death. The progressive increase in transmissibility and virulence of
      SARS-CoV-2 variants will result in a significantly larger, and more
      deadly, pandemic."

    title: Risk of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among spectacles wearing
      population of Northern India
    category: ophthalmology
    abstract: >-
      IntroductionSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
      spread mainly through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Long term
      use of spectacles may prevent repeated touching and rubbing of the eyes.
      Aim of the study is to compare the risk of COVID-19 in long term
      spectacles wearers with the risk in persons not using spectacles.


      ObjectivesTo know the association between infection with SARSCoV-2 and wearing of spectacles.


      Materials and methodsIn this study, 304 patients of Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were selected. Their spectacles wearing behaviour was assessed through a questionnaire. Spectacles wearing behaviour of general population was obtained from older studies (for comparison). Risk of COVID-19 was calculated in long term spectacles wearers as well as in persons not using spectacles. Chi-Square test was used for statistical analysis.


      ResultsIn this study, total 58 patients showed the behavior of using spectacles continuously during day time and always on outdoor activities. The risk of COVID-19 was found 0.48 in spectacles wearing population as compared to 1.35 in population not using spectacles. The calculated risk ratio was 0.36. The protective effectiveness of the spectacles was found statistically significant (p-value .00113).


      ConclusionThe present study showed that the risk of Covid-19 was about 2-3 times less in spectacles wearing population than the population not wearing those. The nasolacrimal duct may be a route of virus transmission from conjunctival sac to the nasopharynx.

    title: "Honey and Nigella sativa against COVID-19 in Pakistan (HNS-COVID-PK): A
      multi-center placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "BACKGROUND: No definitive treatment exists for Coronavirus Disease
      2019 (COVID-19). Honey and Nigella sativa (HNS) have established antiviral
      properties. Hence, we investigated the efficacy of HNS against COVID-19.
      METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized
      clinical trial at 4 centers in Pakistan. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 adults
      showing moderate or severe disease were enrolled in the study. Patients
      presenting with multi-organ failure, ventilator support, and chronic
      diseases (except diabetes mellitus and hypertension) were excluded.
      Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either honey (1
      gm/Kg/day) and Nigella sativa seeds (80 mg/Kg/day) or placebo up-to 13
      days along with standard care. The outcomes included symptom alleviation,
      viral clearance, and 30-day mortality in the intention-to-treat
      population. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
      NCT04347382. FINDINGS Three hundred and thirteen patients - 210 moderate
      and 103 severe - underwent randomization from April 30 to July 29, 2020.
      Among these, 107 were assigned to HNS whereas 103 to placebo for moderate
      cases. For severe cases, 50 were given HNS, and 53 were given placebos.
      HNS resulted in ~50% reduction in time taken to alleviate symptoms as
      compared to placebo (Moderate (4 versus 7 days), Hazard Ratio [HR]: 6.11;
      95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 4.23-8.84, P<0.0001 and severe (6 versus 13
      days) HR: 4.04; 95% CI, 2.46-6.64, P<0.0001). HNS also cleared the virus 4
      days earlier than the placebo group in moderate (6 versus 10 days, HR:
      5.53; 95% CI: 3.76-8.14, P<0.0001) and severe cases (8.5 versus 12 days,
      HR: 4.32; 95% CI: 2.62-7.13, P<0.0001). HNS further led to a better
      clinical score on day 6 with normal activity resumption in 63.6% versus
      10.9% among moderate cases (OR: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.13, P<0.0001) and
      hospital discharge in 50% versus 2.8% in severe cases (OR: 0.03; 95% CI:
      0.01-0.09, P<0.0001). In severe cases, mortality rate was four-fold lower
      in HNS group than placebo (4% versus 18.87%, OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.02-0.92,
      P=0.029). No HNS-related adverse effects were observed. INTERPRETATION HNS
      significantly improved symptoms, viral clearance, and mortality in
      COVID-19 patients. Thus, HNS represents an affordable over the counter
      therapy and can either be used alone or in combination with other
      treatments to achieve potentiating effects against COVID-19. FUNDING:

      Interesting study but I have two questions.


      1. The study indicates "honey (1 gm/Kg/day) and Nigella sativa (80 mg/Kg/day)". The quantity of honey: is it 1 milligram/kg or 1 gram/kg ?  1 g/kg  is a huge quantity (70 g/day for a 70 kg person.

      2. Under what form was the nigella ? Seed, oil, ground seeds....


      Thank you.

    title: Red blood cells injuries and hypersegmented neutrophils in COVID-19
      peripheral blood film
    category: hematology
    abstract: "In the current investigation, peripheral blood films of 15 COVID-19
      patients (44.78{+/-}16.55 years), proven by computed tomographic imaging
      and RT-PCR for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were analyzed at the moment of
      hospital admission. Blood tests showed raised inflammatory markers
      (C-reactive protein 58.2{+/-}61.2 mg/L) with normal values for hemoglobin
      (126.2{+/-}2.6 g/L), WBC (6.8{+/-}18.74 109/L) RBC (4.55{+/-}0.99 1012/L)
      platelets (262.4{+/-}41.8, 109/L) MCV (79.84{+/-}8.2 fL) MCH (28{+/-}3.31
      pg) and MCHC (350.3{+/-}1.15 g/L). The results revealed the presence of
      hypersegmented neutrophils in 66.66%% of the patients. The percentages of
      neutrophils with 4 and 5 lobes were 46.25{+/-}4.83% and 31.5{+/-}14.84%,
      respectively. Three major red blood cells morphological alteration were
      observed: (1) erythrocytes in double primerouleauxdouble prime formation
      represented by linear erythrocytes aggregation, (2) spherocytes with the
      disappearance of the usual biconcave disk, and (3) echinocytes showing
      spiky projections. Apparent reorganization of hemoglobin is found in the
      majority of the analyzed erythrocytes. Rouleaux formation is observed in
      33.33% of patients and spherocytes and echinocytes are present at variable
      levels in the all analyzed patients. The current results revealed
      erythrocytes injuries in COVID-19 peripheral blood, in association with
      hypersegmented neutrophils, alterations that could be involved in the
      respiratory syndrome."

    title: "Reopening Italy's Schools in September 2020: A Bayesian Estimation of
      the Change in the Growth Rate of New SARS-CoV-2 Cases"
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Abstract Objectives: CoViD-19's second wave started a debate on the
      potential role of schools as a primary factor in the contagion resurgence.
      Two opposite positions appeared: those convinced that schools played a
      major role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 infections and those who were not. We
      studied the growth rate of the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in
      all the Italian regions, before and after the school reopening (September
      - October 2020), investigating the hypothesis of an association between
      schools and the resurgence of the virus in Italy. Methods: Using Bayesian
      piecewise linear regression to scrutinize the number of daily SARS-CoV-2
      infections in each Italian, we looked for an estimate of a changepoint in
      the growth rate of those confirmed cases. We compared the changepoints
      with the school opening dates, for each Italian region. The regression
      allows to discuss the change in steepness of the infection curve, before
      and after the changepoint. Results: In 15 out of 21 Italian regions (71%),
      an estimated change in the rate of growth of the total number of daily
      SARS-CoV-2 infection cases occurred after an average of 16.66 days (CI 95%
      14.47 to 18.73) since the school reopening. The number of days required
      for the SARS-CoV-2 daily cases to double went from an average of 47.50
      days (CI 95% 37.18 to 57.61) before the changepoint to an average of 7.72
      days (CI 95% 7.00 to 8.48) after it. Conclusion: Studying the rate of
      growth of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in all the Italian regions provides some
      evidence in favor of a link between school reopening and the resurgence of
      the virus in Italy. The number of factors that could have played a role
      are too many to give a definitive answer. Still, the temporal
      correspondence warrants for a controlled experiment to clarify how much
      reopening schools mattered."

    first_posted: 2021-07-10
    abstract: Peripheral tolerance is thought to result from anergy or deletion of
      self-reactive T cells shortly after antigen encounter. However, the
      frequent occurrences of immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs) following
      checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment suggest a hypothesis that
      immunologically healthy individuals have self-reactive effector T cells
      that are kept in a non-pathogenic state through checkpoint
      receptor-mediated suppression, instead of anergy or deletion. We expressed
      self-antigens in healthy skin and found that antigen-specific CD8 T cells
      infiltrated the tissue, but remained tolerant, despite having a
      transcriptional program that resembled effector T cells found after CPIs.
      These self-reactive PD-1+ CD8 T cells drove IFNg-dependent increases in
      PD-L1 on skin myeloid cells. Blockade of PD-1 or PD-1/CTLA-4 led to
      post-transcriptional upregulation of effector proteins by antigen-specific
      CD8 T cells and elimination of antigen-expressing epithelial cells,
      resulting in localized tissue pathology with features of human cutaneous
      irAEs. This data supports the hypothesis that myeloid cells in healthy
      skin prevent pathology from self-reactive effector CD8 T cells through the
      PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.

    title: Symptomatic, Presymptomatic, and Asymptomatic Transmission of SARS-CoV-2
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Importance: Asymptomatic and presymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2
      are an ongoing and significant risk for community spread of the virus,
      especially with the majority of the world still unvaccinated and new
      variants emerging. Objective: To quantify the presence and effects of
      symptom presentation (or lack thereof) on the community transmission
      ofSARS-CoV-2. Design: A cohort of 12,960 young adults participated in
      health reporting, contact tracing, and COVID-19 testing for 103 days
      between August 10 and November 20, 2020. Setting: A mid-sized university
      campus in Indiana, United States. Participants: University students, most
      of whom are 18-23 years old (67%) and living in congregate on-campus
      housing (60%). Of the 12,960 students, 1,556 (12.0%) tested positive for
      COVID-19 during the 103 day period. Of the positive cases, 1,198 reported
      sufficient health check data (7 days prior and 7 days post diagnosis) to
      be classified as asymptomatic or symptomatic. Main Outcome: Secondary
      attack rate, based on presentation or absence of symptoms and type of
      symptoms calculated with respect to confirmed close contacts and a 14-day
      incubation period, varies on the type of symptom, timing of symptoms, and
      absence of symptoms. A quantifiable understanding of SAR on the
      longitudinal data of more than one thousand subjects in a university
      environment provides keen insights about developing strategies to respond
      to the continued prevalence of COVID-19 in the unvaccinated world and
      growth of variants. Results: 32.5% of all cases reported no symptoms
      within a 15-day window centered on their positive test (7 days prior, the
      day of the positive test, and 7 days after). The secondary attack rate
      (SAR) of asymptomatic COVID-19 index cases was 19.1%. The SAR of
      symptomatic index cases was 25.4%, and while the onset timing of symptoms
      did not affect transmission, the presence of certain symptoms like fever,
      shortness of breath, and dry cough increased the SAR as high as 30.0%.
      Conclusions and Relevance: Asymptomatic rates of transmission of
      SARS-CoV-2 are much higher than has been estimated in prior studies and
      continue to pose a significant and ongoing risk in the pandemic,
      especially with the prevalence of variants like the Delta variant. In
      addition, different symptoms are associated with varying rates of
      transmission, posing a significant challenge in how to diagnose or assess
      risk through mechanisms such as daily health checks for symptom reporting,
      a practice commonly in place for entry into schools, offices, restaurants,
      etc. Given the uncertain nature of symptoms and varied transmission rates,
      this study suggests a broader embrace of masking, social distancing and
      testing might be needed to counter the variants until higher global
      vaccination rates can be achieved."

      Hi.

      In my opinion, it’s impossible affirm that the “assymptomatic” cases was transmiting the virus without verify the cycle threshold of RT-PCR detecting RNA at oropharyngeal swabs samples. Only reporting like positive or negative is insuficient for affirm infectivity.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 infection
      among previously infected or vaccinated employees
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Introduction: The protective effect of previous infection versus
      vaccination is poorly studied. Among a clinical laboratory that has been
      conducting routine workforce screening since the beginning of the
      pandemic, we aimed to assess the relative risk of Severe Acute Respiratory
      Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among individuals who were
      SARS-CoV-2 naive, previously infected, or vaccinated. Methods: Using an
      electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into
      three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naive and unvaccinated, (2) previous
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from
      the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the
      observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive
      SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14
      days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95%
      confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The
      incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between
      groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station,
      TX). Results: We identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups
      1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age of employees was 29.0 years
      (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 254, 0,
      and 4 infections were identified among groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
      Group 1 had an incidence of 25.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 22.8-29.3).
      Group 2 had an incidence of 0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0-5.0). Group
      3 had an incidence of 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.04-4.2). The IRR
      of reinfection among those with previous infection compared to SARS-CoV-2
      naive was 0 (95% CI: 0-0.19). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to
      SARS-CoV-2 naive was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.16). The IRR of those vaccinated
      compared to prior SARS-CoV-2 was 0 (95% CI: 0-4.98). Conclusion: Previous
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with
      decreased risk for infection or re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a
      routinely screened workforce. The was no difference in the infection
      incidence between vaccinated individuals and individuals with previous
      infection. Further research is needed to determine whether our results are
      consistent with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants."

      Published reports state:  "“The big takeaway was that if you are not
      vaccinated, and were not previously infected, one, you have a very high
      risk getting infected—24 percent of employees over a year tested
      positive." (Epoch times).  But I see only 254 out of 4,313, which is
      5.8%.  Even allowing for a doubling of the timeline (to a full year?)
      that's around 11-12%, which is fairly in line with what the Brits
      published in May in The Lancet.

      SECOND - it's obvious to me that there is a likelihood that the number of infections are seasonal.  IF those who got injections were vaccinated on the downward slope (ie, Feb 21 forward) instead of the upward slope of Dec 20-Jan 21, wouldn't the results be much different?  So studying those who got the vaccine would have to take into account the prevailing non-study environment, correct?  A non-vaccinated person wasn't very likely to get COVID in June of this year, or June of last year, correct?

    title: Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.617.2 variant
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: The B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant has contributed to the
      surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe,
      including a notable increase in cases in the UK. We estimate the
      effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against this
      variant. Methods: A test negative case control design was used to estimate
      the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both
      variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases
      identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all
      symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate
      the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain
      (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status. Results: Effectiveness was notably lower
      after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3)
      compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results
      for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 93.4%
      (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with
      B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI:
      54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2.
      Sequenced cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had a higher
      odds of infection with B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40;
      95%CI: 1.13-1.75). Conclusions: After 2 doses of either vaccine there were
      only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2
      variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked
      with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with two doses
      among vulnerable groups."

    title: "AltumAge: A Pan-Tissue DNA-Methylation Epigenetic Clock Based on Deep
      Learning"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Several age predictors based on DNA methylation, dubbed epigenetic
      clocks, have been created in recent years. Their accuracy and potential
      for generalization vary widely based on the training data. Here, we
      gathered 143 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to
      develop AltumAge, a highly accurate and precise age predictor based on
      deep learning. Compared to Horvath's 2013 model, AltumAge performs better
      across both normal and malignant tissues and is more generalizable to new
      data sets. Interestingly, it can predict gestational week from placental
      tissue with low error. Lastly, we used deep learning interpretation
      methods to learn which methylation sites contributed to the final model
      predictions. We observed that while most important CpG sites are linearly
      related to age, some highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the
      relevance of such relationships. We studied the associated genes of these
      CpG sites and found literary evidence of their involvement in age-related
      gene regulation. Using chromatin annotations, we observed that the CpG
      sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions were related
      to heterochromatin and gene regulatory regions in the genome. We also
      found age-related KEGG pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. In
      general, neural networks are better predictors due to their ability to
      capture complex feature interactions compared to the typically used
      regularized linear regression. Altogether, our neural network approach
      provides significant improvement and flexibility to current epigenetic
      clocks without sacrificing model interpretability.

    title: Microbiome divergence of marine gastropod species separated by the

    category: ecology
    abstract: The rise of the Isthmus of Panama ~3.5 mya separated populations of
      many marine organisms, which then diverged into new geminate sister
      species currently living in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.
      However, we know very little about how such evolutionary divergences of
      host species have shaped their microbiomes. Here, we compared the
      microbiomes of whole-body and shell-surface samples of geminate species of
      marine gastropods in the genera Cerithium and Cerithideopsis to those of
      congeneric outgroups. Our results show that the effects of the Isthmus on
      microbiome composition varied among host genera and between sample types
      within the same hosts. In the whole-body samples, microbiome compositions
      of geminate species pairs in the focal genera tended to be similar, likely
      due to host filtering, although the strength of this relationship varied
      among the two groups and across similarity metrics. Shell-surface
      communities show contrasting patterns, with co-divergence between the host
      taxa and a small number of microbial clades evident in Cerithideopsis, but
      not Cerithium. These results suggest that (i) the rise of the Isthmus of
      Panama affected microbiomes of geminate hosts in a complex and
      clade-specific manner and (ii) host-associated microbial taxa respond
      differently to vicariance events than the hosts themselves.

    title: Using Y-chromosome capture enrichment to resolve haplogroup H2 shows new
      evidence for a two-Path Neolithic expansion to Western Europe
    category: genetics
    abstract: >-
      Uniparentally-inherited markers on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the
      non-recombining regions of the Y chromosome (NRY), have been used for the
      past 30 years to investigate the history of humans from a maternal and
      paternal perspective.


      Researchers have preferred mtDNA due to its abundance in the cells, and comparatively high substitution rate. Conversely, the NRY is less susceptible to back mutations and saturation, and is potentially more informative than mtDNA owing to its longer sequence length. However, due to comparatively poor NRY coverage via shotgun sequencing, and the relatively low and biased representation of Y-chromosome variants on capture arrays such as the 1240K, ancient DNA studies often fail to utilize the unique perspective that the NRY can yield.


      Here we introduce a new DNA enrichment assay, coined YMCA (Y-mappable capture assay), that targets the "mappable" regions of the NRY. We show that compared to low-coverage shotgun sequencing and 1240K capture, YMCA significantly improves the coverage and number of sites hit on the NRY, increasing the number of Y-haplogroup informative SNPs, and allowing for the identification of previously undiscovered variants.


      To illustrate the power of YMCA, we show that the analysis of ancient Y-chromosome lineages can help to resolve Y-chromosomal haplogroups. As a case study, we focus on H2, a haplogroup associated with a critical event in European human history: the Neolithic transition. By disentangling the evolutionary history of this haplogroup, we further elucidate the two separate paths by which early farmers expanded from Anatolia and the Near East to western Europe.

    title: "Your head is there to move you around: Goal-driven models of the primate
      dorsal pathway"
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: "Neurons in the dorsal visual pathway of the mammalian brain are
      selective for motion stimuli, with the complexity of stimulus
      representations increasing along the hierarchy. This progression is
      similar to that of the ventral visual pathway, which is well characterized
      by artificial neural networks (ANNs) optimized for object recognition. In
      contrast, there are no image-computable models of the dorsal stream with
      comparable explanatory power. We hypothesized that the properties of
      dorsal stream neurons could be explained by a simple learning objective:
      the need for an organism to orient itself during self-motion. To test this
      hypothesis, we trained a 3D ResNet in a self-supervised manner to predict
      an agent's self-motion parameters from visual stimuli in a simulated
      environment. We found that the responses in this network accounted well
      for the selectivity of neurons in a large database of single-neuron
      recordings from the dorsal visual stream of non-human primates. In
      contrast, ANNs trained for action recognition or with a contrastive
      objective could not explain responses in the dorsal stream, despite also
      being trained on naturalistic videos with moving objects. These results
      demonstrate that an ecologically relevant, self-supervised cost function
      can account for dorsal stream properties in the primate brain."

    title: Bayesian inference of clonal expansions in a dated phylogeny
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Microbial population genetics models often assume that all lineages
      are constrained by the same population size dynamics over time. However,
      many neutral and selective events can invalidate this assumption, and can
      contribute to the clonal expansion of a specific lineage relative to the
      rest of the population. Such differential phylodynamic properties between
      lineages result in asymmetries and imbalances in phylogenetic trees that
      are sometimes described informally but difficult to analyse formally. To
      this end, we developed a model of how clonal expansions occur and affect
      the branching patterns of a phylogeny. We show how the parameters of this
      model can be inferred from a given dated phylogeny using Bayesian
      statistics, which allows us to assess the probability that one or more
      clonal expansion events occurred. For each putative clonal expansion event
      we estimate their date of emergence and subsequent phylodynamic
      trajectories, including their long-term evolutionary potential which is
      important to determine how much effort should be placed on specific
      control measures. We demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology on
      simulated and real datasets.

      Great idea and a very nicely implemented tool! We particularly appreciated
      the analysis vignettes with strep pnuemo and staph aureus. We started
      experimenting with it last week as it provides a nice addition to one of
      our current studies.  


      We do have a couple practical questions about "best practices"...

      1) Are there any considerations for how the initial time-scaled tree is inferred?  For example, if you performed model testing with BEAST and found that a skygrid demographic model with relaxed clock best fit, would this violate the underlying assumption of constant background population size?  In this scenario, would it correctly identify the expanding lineages but underestimate the effective population size of the expansion?  Would a better approach be to infer an initial tree using a relaxed clock and constant population size?


      2) Regarding the analysis of SPN, are there any thoughts to how recombination would impact the performance of the tool? I am less concerned about ancestral recombination that is generally shared by all members of the population of interest. However, if the expansion of a lineage was associated with a recombination event (e.g., a capsule switch in pneumo or even just a large recombination block impacting protein antigens), how would that bias the detection of the expansion or the population size in relation to the background? (We can assume these events were detected and censored before coalescent analysis)


      I don't expect endless simulations to address all the different possible population dynamics, but I think some comments about the recombination questions would be of general interest to those of us that work on highly recombining bacteria.  


      Thanks again and great work!

    category: microbiology
    abstract: >-
      Malaria remains a major global health problem, and there exists a constant
      need to identify druggable weaknesses in P. falciparum biology. The
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has many essential roles in the asexual
      lifecycle and may offer new drug targets, but it remains critically
      understudied. We generated conditional mutants of the putative
      redox-active, ER chaperone PfJ2, and show that it is essential for
      parasite survival. Using a redox-active cysteine crosslinker, we identify
      its substrates to be other mediators of oxidative folding, PfPDI8 and
      PfPDI11, suggesting a redox-regulatory role for PfJ2. Knockdown of these
      protein disulfide isomerases in PfJ2 conditional mutants show that PfPDI11
      is not essential, while PfPDI8 is essential for asexual growth and may
      work in a complex with PfJ2 and other ER chaperones. Finally, we show that
      these redox interactions in the parasite ER are sensitive to small
      molecule inhibition. Together these data build a model for how oxidative
      folding occurs in the P. falciparum ER and demonstrate its suitability for
      antimalarial drug development.

    title: Association of country-wide coronavirus mortality with demographics,
      testing, lockdowns, and public wearing of masks.
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Purpose. To determine sources of variation between countries in
      per-capita mortality from COVID-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus).
      Methods. Potential predictors of per-capita coronavirus-related mortality
      in 200 countries by May 9, 2020 were examined, including age, sex, obesity
      prevalence, temperature, urbanization, smoking, duration of infection,
      lockdowns, viral testing, contact tracing policies, and public
      mask-wearing norms and policies. Multivariable linear regression analysis
      was performed. Results. In univariate analyses, the prevalence of smoking,
      per-capita gross domestic product, urbanization, and colder average
      country temperature were positively associated with coronavirus-related
      mortality. In a multivariable analysis of 196 countries, the duration of
      infection in the country, and the proportion of the population 60 years of
      age or older were positively associated with per-capita mortality, while
      duration of mask-wearing by the public was negatively associated with
      mortality (all p<0.001). International travel restrictions and a lower
      prevalence of obesity were independently associated with mortality in a
      model which controlled for testing policy. Internal lockdown requirements
      and viral testing policies and levels were not associated with mortality.
      The association of contact tracing policy with mortality approached
      statistical significance (p=0.06). In countries with cultural norms or
      government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus
      mortality increased on average by just 15.8% each week, as compared with
      62.1% each week in remaining countries. Conclusions. Societal norms and
      government policies supporting the wearing of masks by the public, as well
      as international travel controls, are independently associated with lower
      per-capita mortality from COVID-19.

    title: Transmission event of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant reveals multiple vaccine
      breakthrough infections
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: >-
      ImportanceVaccine breakthrough by an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant poses a
      great risk to global public health.


      ObjectiveTo determine the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough.


      DesignNasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR for Wuhan-Hu1 and Alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant.


      SettingTransmission event occurred at events surrounding a wedding outside of Houston, TX. Two patients from India, likely transmitted the Delta variant to other guests.


      ParticipantsFollowing a positive SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test at a third-party site, six fully vaccinated patients were investigated. Three males and three females ranged from 53 to 69 years old. One patient suffered from diabetes while three others were classified as overweight. No significant other comorbidities were identified. None of the patients had a history of failed vaccination.


      Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich SARS-CoV-2 variant is responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough, one interventional monoclonal antibody treatment, and one death?


      FindingsViral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no histories of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152.


      MeaningDelta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough.

    title: Real World Effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines against
      Hospitalizations and Deaths in the United States
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Covid-19 has caused significant global mortality.
      Multiple vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials though
      real-world effectiveness of vaccines against Covid-19 mortality in
      clinically and demographically diverse populations has not yet been
      reported. Methods: We used a retrospective cohort assembled from a
      cross-institution comprehensive data repository. Established patients of
      the health care system were categorized as not immunized, partially
      immunized, or fully immunized against SARS-CoV-2 with an mRNA vaccine
      through April 4, 2021. Outcomes were Covid-19 related hospitalization and
      death. Results: Of the 91,134 established patients, 70.2% were not
      immunized, 4.5% were partially immunized and 25.4% were fully immunized.
      Among the fully immunized 0.7% had a Covid-19 hospitalization, whereas
      3.4% among the partially immunized and 2.7% non-immunized individuals were
      hospitalized with Covid-19. Of the 225 deaths among Covid-19
      hospitalizations, 219 (97.3%) were in the not immunized, 5 (2.2%) in the
      partially immunized, and 1 (0.0041%) in the fully immunized group. mRNA
      vaccines were 96% (95%CI: 95 - 99) effective at preventing Covid-19
      related hospitalization and 98.7% (95%CI: 91.0 - 99.8) effective at
      preventing Covid-19 related death when participants were fully vaccinated.
      Partial vaccination was 77% (95%CI: 71 - 82) effective at preventing
      hospitalization and 64.2% (95%CI: 13.0 - 85.2) effective at preventing
      death. Vaccine effectiveness at preventing hospitalization was conserved
      across subgroups of age, race, ethnicity, Area Deprivation Index, and
      Charlson Comorbidity Index. Conclusions: In a large, diverse cohort in the
      United States, full immunization with mRNA vaccines was highly effective
      in the real-world scenario at preventing Covid-19 related hospitalization
      and death."

      Will note that absolute risk reduction between vaccinated and unvaccinated
      is 0.32%. The authors’ claims that the vaccines prevented death are not
      supported by the evidence provided, which is correlated in nature, not
      causative.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      Thank you for the data collection.  I hope you continue the study for some
      months. The infected immunity indicated here may be less for other Covid
      variants.
       Delving into recent UK variant Delta sequence confirmed reinfections of 285 as of May 31 out of 22571 sequences by sample date. For Delta prior infection immunity appears similar to two shot vaccination immunity. Just taking the last two or three months of your data if similar infected immunity to vaccinated immunity was tested the smaller prior infected unvaccinated population would be expected to have 1.2 or so cases compared to the 15 from the larger vaccinated population. Thus the very large confidence interval reported.
       I prefer seeing person days used as in the Haas et al paper.  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00947-8/fulltext
       How many cases of reinfection if any occurred within the 90 day post positive sample period? Figure 3. the sums of previous infected and not previously infected both monotonically decrease until increasing in the last column.  Better to note the number of persons who have passed the 90 day interval since prior infection as this number would be increasing especially around the beginning of the study.  The UK study had a vast majority of possible reinfections sampled just after that 90 day interval.

    abstract: RtcB enzymes are RNA ligases that play essential roles in tRNA
      splicing, unfolded protein response, and RNA repair. In metazoa, RtcB
      functions as part of a five-subunit tRNA ligase complex (tRNA-LC) along
      with Ddx1, Cgi-99, Fam98B and Ashwin. The human tRNA-LC or its individual
      subunits have been implicated in additional cellular processes including
      microRNA maturation, viral replication, DNA double-strand break repair and
      mRNA transport. Here we present a biochemical analysis of the intersubunit
      interactions within the human tRNA-LC along with crystal structures of the
      catalytic subunit RTCB and the N-terminal domain of CGI-99. We show that
      the core of the human tRNA-LC is assembled from RTCB and the C-terminal
      alpha-helical regions of DDX1, CGI-99, and FAM98B, all of which are
      required for complex integrity. The N-terminal domain of CGI-99 displays
      structural homology to calponin-homology domains, and CGI-99 and FAM98B
      associate via their N-terminal domains to form a stable subcomplex. The
      crystal structure of GMP-bound RTCB reveals divalent metal coordination
      geometry in the active site, providing insights into its catalytic
      mechanism. Collectively, these findings shed light on the molecular
      architecture and mechanism of the human tRNA ligase complex, and provide a
      structural framework for understanding its functions in cellular RNA
      metabolism.

      ObjectiveTo determine the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough.


      DesignNasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR for Wuhan-Hu1 and Alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant.

      ParticipantsFollowing a positive SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test at a third-party site, six fully vaccinated patients were investigated. Three males and three females ranged from 53 to 69 years old. One patient suffered from diabetes while three others were classified as overweight. No significant other comorbidities were identified. None of the patients had a history of failed vaccination.


      Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich SARS-CoV-2 variant is responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough, one interventional monoclonal antibody treatment, and one death?


      FindingsViral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no histories of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152.


      MeaningDelta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough.

    title: Addressing anti-syncytin antibody levels, and fertility and breastfeeding
      concerns, following BNT162B2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccination
    category: obstetrics-and-gynecology
    abstract: "Objective: To determine whether antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2
      spike protein following BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 mRNA
      vaccination cross-react with human syncytin-1 protein, and if BNT162B2
      mRNA enters breast milk. Methods: In this observational cohort study of
      female front-line workers with no history of COVID-19 infection, we
      amplified BNT162B2 mRNA in plasma and breast milk and assayed
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and anti-human syncytin-1 binding
      antibodies in plasma, at early (1-4 days) and late (4-7 weeks) time points
      following first-dose vaccination. Results: Fifteen consented participants
      (mean age 40.4 years, various ethnicities) who received at least one dose
      of BNT162B2, including five breast-feeding women and two women who were
      inadvertently vaccinated in early pregnancy, were recruited. BNT162B2
      mRNA, detected by amplifying part of the spike-encoding region, was
      detected in plasma 1-4 days following the first dose (n=13), but not 4-5
      weeks later (n=2), nor was the mRNA isolated from aqueous or lipid breast
      milk fractions collected 0-7 days post-vaccination (n=5). Vaccine
      recipients demonstrated strong SARS-CoV-2 neutralising activity by at
      least four weeks after the first dose (n=15), including the two pregnant
      women. None had placental anti-syncytin-1 binding antibodies at either
      time-point following vaccination. Conclusions: BNT162B2-vaccinated women
      did not transmit vaccine mRNA to breast milk, and did not produce a
      concurrent humoral response to syncytin-1, suggesting that
      cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 on the developing trophoblast, or other
      adverse effects in the breast-fed infant from vaccine mRNA ingestion, are
      unlikely."

    title: Estimation of COVID-19 transmission rates in California and the U.S. with
      reporting delays
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: We estimated time-varying reproduction numbers of COVID-19
      transmission in counties and regions of California and in states of the
      United States, using the Wallinga-Teunis method of estimations applied to
      publicly available data. The serial interval distribution assumed
      incorporates wide uncertainty in delays from symptom onset to case
      reporting. This assumption contributes smoothing and a small but
      meaningful increase in numerical estimates of reproduction numbers due to
      the likely existence of secondary cases not yet reported. Transmission in
      many areas of the U.S. may not yet be controlled, including areas in which
      case counts appear to be stable or slowly declining.

    abstract: Large-volume ultrastructural mapping approaches yield detailed circuit
      wiring diagrams but lack an integrated synaptic activity readout which is
      essential for functional interpretation of the connectome. Here we resolve
      this limitation by combining functional synaptic labelling in vivo with
      focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIBSEM) and machine
      learning-based segmentation. Our approach generates high-resolution
      near-isotropic three-dimensional readouts of activated vesicle pools
      across large populations of individual synapses in a volume of tissue,
      opening the way for detailed functional connectomics studies. We apply
      this method to measure presynaptic activity in an ultrastructural context
      in synapses activated by sensory input in primary visual cortex in awake
      head-fixed mice, showing that the numbers of recycling and non-recycling
      vesicles approximate to a lognormal distribution across a large number of
      synapses. We also demonstrate that neighbouring boutons of the same axon,
      which share the same spiking activity, can differ greatly in their
      presynaptic release probability.

    title: Transmission event of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant reveals multiple vaccine
      breakthrough infections
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: >-
      ImportanceVaccine breakthrough by an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant poses a
      great risk to global public health.


      ObjectiveTo determine the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough.


      DesignNasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR for Wuhan-Hu1 and Alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant.


      SettingTransmission event occurred at events surrounding a wedding outside of Houston, TX. Two patients from India, likely transmitted the Delta variant to other guests.


      ParticipantsFollowing a positive SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test at a third-party site, six fully vaccinated patients were investigated. Three males and three females ranged from 53 to 69 years old. One patient suffered from diabetes while three others were classified as overweight. No significant other comorbidities were identified. None of the patients had a history of failed vaccination.


      Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich SARS-CoV-2 variant is responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough, one interventional monoclonal antibody treatment, and one death?


      FindingsViral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no histories of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152.


      MeaningDelta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough.

    title: "The accuracy of novel antigen rapid diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2: a living
      systematic review and meta-analysis."
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are
      increasingly being inte-grated in testing strategies around the world.
      Studies of the Ag-RDTs have shown variable performance. In this systematic
      review and meta-analysis, we assessed the clinical accuracy (sensi-tivity
      and specificity) of commercially available Ag-RDTs. Methods: We registered
      the review on PROSPERO (Registration number: CRD42020225140). We
      systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core
      Collection, medRvix and bioRvix, FINDdx) for publications up until
      December 11th, 2020. Descriptive analyses of all studies were performed
      and when more than four studies were avail-able, a random-effects
      meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity in
      comparison to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. We
      assessed heterogeneity by subgroup analyses ((1) performed conform with
      manufacturers instructions for use (IFU) or not, (2) symptomatic vs.
      asymptomatic, (3) duration of symptoms less than seven days vs. more than
      seven days, (4) Ct-value <25 vs. <30 vs. >30, (5) by sample type)) and
      with meta-regression. We assessed study quality and risk of bias using the
      QUADAS 2 assessment tool. Results: From a total of 11,715 articles, we
      extracted 98 analytical and clinical data sets. 74 clinical accuracy data
      sets were evaluated that included 31,202 samples. Across all meta-analyzed
      samples, the pooled Ag-RDT sensitivity was 73.8% (CI 68.6 to 78.5). If
      analysis was re-stricted to studies that followed the Ag-RDT manufacturers
      instructions using fresh upper res-piratory swab samples, the sensitivity
      increased to 79.1% (95%CI 75.0 to 82.8). The SD Biosensor Standard Q and
      Abbott Panbio showed the highest sensitivity with 81.7% and 72.7%,
      respectively. The best Ag-RDT performance was found with nasopharyngeal
      sampling (77.3%, CI 72.0 to 81.9) in comparison to other sample types
      (e.g., anterior nasal or mid turbinate 63.5%, CI 49.5 to 75.5). Testing in
      the first week from symptom onset resulted in higher sensitivity (87.5%,
      CI 86.0 to 89.1) compared to testing after one week (64.1%, CI 54.4 to
      73.8). The tests performed markedly better on samples with lower
      Ct-values, i.e., <30 (87.9%, CI 86.7 to 88.8), in comparison to those with
      Ct >30 (47.8%, CI 41.1 to 54.5). Bias concerns were raised across all data
      sets, and financial support from the manufacturer was reported in 28.2% of
      data sets. Conclusion: As Ag-RDTs detect most cases within the first week
      of symptom onset and those with high viral load, they can have high
      utility for screening purposes in the early phase of disease, and thus can
      be a valuable tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Standardization of
      con-duct and reporting of clinical accuracy studies would improve
      comparability and use of data."

      It seems that this SRMA lacks of data elaboration/transformation procedure
      at all. For instance, in our paper (icluded in this review) it has been
      clearly stated that no false positive results were detected. It is
      therefore obvious that the specificity is 100%. The overall specificity
      with 95% CIs was reported "The overall sensitivity and specificity were
      therefore 78.7% (95% CI: 73.2%–83.3%) and 100% (95% CI: 94.7%–100%),
      respectively". The authors instead stated that the specificity estimate
      was not reported. I agree that we had not reported the 100% specificity
      for each test analyzed in order to save the space. To us, it was clear.
       You only needed to calculate the 95% CI from the available raw data.

    title: Transmission event of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant reveals multiple vaccine
      breakthrough infections
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: >-
      ImportanceVaccine breakthrough by an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant poses a
      great risk to global public health.


      ObjectiveTo determine the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough.


      DesignNasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR for Wuhan-Hu1 and Alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant.


      SettingTransmission event occurred at events surrounding a wedding outside of Houston, TX. Two patients from India, likely transmitted the Delta variant to other guests.


      ParticipantsFollowing a positive SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test at a third-party site, six fully vaccinated patients were investigated. Three males and three females ranged from 53 to 69 years old. One patient suffered from diabetes while three others were classified as overweight. No significant other comorbidities were identified. None of the patients had a history of failed vaccination.


      Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich SARS-CoV-2 variant is responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough, one interventional monoclonal antibody treatment, and one death?


      FindingsViral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no histories of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152.


      MeaningDelta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough.

    title: Modeling the Spread and Control of COVID-19
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Data-centric models of COVID-19 have been tried, but have certain
      limitations. In this work, we propose an agent-based model of the epidemic
      in a confined space of agents representing humans. An extension to the
      SEIR model allows us to consider the difference between the appearance
      (black-box view) of the spread of disease, and the real situation
      (glass-box view). Our model allows for simulations of lockdowns, social
      distancing, personal hygiene, quarantine, and hospitalization, with
      further considerations of different parameters such as the extent to which
      hygiene and social distancing are observed in a population. Our results
      give qualitative indications of the effects of various policies and
      parameters; for instance, that lockdowns by themselves are extremely
      unlikely to bring an end to an epidemic and may indeed make things worse,
      that social distancing matters more than personal hygiene, and that the
      growth of infection comes down significantly for moderately high levels of
      social distancing and hygiene, even in the absence of herd immunity.

    title: Design considerations for workflow management systems use in production
      genomics research and the clinic
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: 'Background: The changing landscape of genomics research and clinical
      practice has created a need for computational pipelines capable of
      efficiently orchestrating complex analysis stages while handling large
      volumes of data across heterogeneous computational environments. Workflow
      Management Systems (WfMSs) are the software components employed to fill
      this gap. Results: This work provides an approach and systematic
      evaluation of key features of popular bioinformatics WfMSs in use today:
      Nextflow, CWL, and WDL and some of their executors, along with Swift/T, a
      workflow manager commonly used in high-scale physics applications. We
      employed two use cases: a variant-calling genomic pipeline and a
      scalability-testing framework, where both were run locally, on an HPC
      cluster, and in the cloud. This allowed for evaluation of those four WfMSs
      in terms of language expressiveness, modularity, scalability, robustness,
      reproducibility, interoperability, ease of development, along with
      adoption and usage in research labs and healthcare settings. This article
      is trying to answer, "which WfMS should be chosen for a given
      bioinformatics application regardless of analysis type?". Conclusions: The
      choice of a given WfMS is a function of both its intrinsic language and
      engine features. Within bioinformatics, where analysts are a mix of dry
      and wet lab scientists, the choice is also governed by collaborations and
      adoption within large consortia and technical support provided by the WfMS
      team/community. As the community and its needs continue to evolve along
      with computational infrastructure, WfMSs will also evolve, especially
      those with permissive licenses that allow commercial use. In much the same
      way as the dataflow paradigm and containerization are now well understood
      to be very useful in bioinformatics applications, we will continue to see
      innovations of tools and utilities for other purposes, like big data
      technologies, interoperability, and provenance.'

      Thank you much for the valuable comments. We noticed the `queueSize`
      directive after having finished our testing phase, and it was too late
      then, hence we reported this possibility in this version.



      We have now re-done the scalability benchmarks with more recent versions of the runners, and for Nextflow, using the `queueSize` in tandem with the `maxForks` directive. The results we obtained were done on our HPC in a repeated set of 5 experiments (https://github.com/azzaea/scalability-tst#references). To some extent, we still see the same general patterns in terms of which runner is faster, and how runners distribute tasks across nodes. Admittedly though, we did not run these experiments on AWS, so we did not reach the previously tested high limits of performance.



      That said, a nice realization from these re-runs is the improved performance overall obtained by the new versions of the tools- kudos to all the developers and the community indeed!



      Finally, an update version of the manuscript should be up promptly as well, with these edits and others (and our apologies for mis-writing your last name @pditommaso:disqus).

    title: SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern exhibit reduced sensitivity to live-virus
      neutralization in sera from CoronaVac vaccinees and naturally infected
      COVID-19 patients
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Recent surges in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) call for the
      need to evaluate levels of vaccine- and infection- induced SARS-CoV-2
      neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech, Beijing,
      China) is currently being used for mass vaccination in Thailand as well as
      other low-income countries. Three VOCs currently circulating within
      Thailand include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2
      (Delta) strains. We assessed NAb potency against the prototypic strain
      containing the original spike sequence (WT) compared to that against the 3
      VOCs using sera derived from a cohort of healthcare workers who received a
      full 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac. Sera from two other cohorts consisting
      of COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 and 2021 were
      evaluated for comparison. We found that, despite equally robust production
      of S1-RBD-binding IgG and 100% seropositivity, sera from both CoronaVac
      vaccinees and naturally infected individuals had significantly reduced
      neutralizing capacity against all 3 VOCs compared to WT. Strikingly, NAb
      titers against Alpha and Beta were comparable, but Delta appears to be
      significantly more refractory to NAbs in all groups. Our results may help
      inform on CoronaVac NAb-inducing capacity, which is a proxy for vaccine
      efficacy, in the context of the WT strain and 3 VOCs. Our results also
      have critical implications for public health decisionmakers who may need
      to maintain efficient mitigation strategies amid a potentially high risk
      for infection with VOCs even in those who have been previously infected.

    abstract: Lipids play important modulatory and structural roles for membrane
      proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations are frequently used to provide
      insights into the nature of these protein-lipid interactions. Systematic
      comparative analysis requires tools that provide algorithms for objective
      assessment of such interactions. We introduce PyLipID, a python package
      for the identification and characterization of specific lipid interactions
      and binding sites on membrane proteins from molecular dynamics
      simulations. PyLipID uses a community analysis approach for binding site
      detection, calculating lipid residence times for both the individual
      protein residues and the detected binding sites. To assist structural
      analysis, PyLipID produces representative bound lipid poses from
      simulation data, using a density-based scoring function. To estimate
      residue contacts robustly, PyLipID uses a dual-cutoff scheme to
      differentiate between lipid conformational rearrangements whilst bound
      from full dissociation events. In addition to the characterization of
      protein-lipid interactions, PyLipID is applicable to analysis of the
      interactions of membrane proteins with other ligands. By combining
      automated analysis, efficient algorithms, and open-source distribution,
      PyLipID facilitates the systematic analysis of lipid interactions from
      large simulation datasets of multiple species of membrane proteins.

    title: "Diet quality and risk and severity of COVID-19: a prospective cohort
      study"
    category: nutrition
    abstract: "Objective: Poor metabolic health and certain lifestyle factors have
      been associated with risk and severity of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), but data for diet are lacking. We aimed to investigate the
      association of diet quality with risk and severity of COVID-19 and its
      intersection with socioeconomic deprivation. Design: We used data from
      592,571 participants of the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study. Diet
      quality was assessed using a healthful plant-based diet score, which
      emphasizes healthy plant foods such as fruits or vegetables. Multivariable
      Cox models were fitted to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CI) for COVID-19 risk and severity defined using a
      validated symptom-based algorithm or hospitalization with oxygen support,
      respectively. Results: Over 3,886,274 person-months of follow-up, 31,815
      COVID-19 cases were documented. Compared with individuals in the lowest
      quartile of the diet score, high diet quality was associated with lower
      risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) and severe COVID-19 (HR,
      0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74). The joint association of low diet quality and
      increased deprivation on COVID-19 risk was higher than the sum of the risk
      associated with each factor alone (Pinteraction=0.005). The corresponding
      absolute excess rate for lowest vs highest quartile of diet score was 22.5
      (95% CI, 18.8-26.3) and 40.8 (95% CI, 31.7-49.8; 10,000 person-months)
      among persons living in areas with low and high deprivation, respectively.
      Conclusions: A dietary pattern characterized by healthy plant-based foods
      was associated with lower risk and severity of COVID-19. These association
      may be particularly evident among individuals living in areas with higher
      socioeconomic deprivation."

      What's truly interesting is that no one is talking about Fructose and
      refined sugar  activating long term NLRP3 inflammasome in the Monocyte
      which reprograms the monocyte on a path of inflammation and upregulation
      of Reactive oxygen species which lowers nitric oxide in Endothelium.  Sars
      CoV-2 seems to have a knack of exploiting and exacerbating this chronic
      inflammation in patients leading to an acute medical malody.  


      What deactivates NLRP3 inflammasome?  Olive Oil, Melatonin, Vitamin D Fish Oil, Resveritrol, Quercetin etal.  Been taking doses of Oleic Acid for months because of all the research I was finding.  Cashews high in Oleic Acid.  If this all comes down to Anti Oxidants vs Oxidants then medicine is going to have serious explaining to do.  Unfortunately that would never get out.

    title: Bayesian modeling for the detection of adverse events underreporting in
      clinical trials
    category: health-systems-and-quality-improvement
    abstract: Introduction Safety underreporting is a recurrent issue in clinical
      trials that can impact patient safety and data integrity. Clinical Quality
      Assurance (QA) practices used to detect underreporting rely on on-site
      audits, however adverse events underreporting remains a recurrent issue.
      In a recent project, we developed a predictive model that enables
      oversight of Adverse Event (AE) reporting for clinical Quality Program
      Leads (QPL). However, there were limitations to using solely a machine
      learning model. Objective Our primary objective was to propose a robust
      method to compute the probability of AE underreporting that could
      complement our machine learning model. Our model was developed to enhance
      patients safety while reducing the need for on-site and manual QA
      activities in clinical trials. Methods We used a Bayesian hierarchical
      model to estimate the site reporting rates and assess the risk of
      underreporting. We designed the model with Project Data Sphere clinical
      trial data that is public and anonymized. Results We built a model that
      infers the site reporting behavior from patient-level observations and
      compares them across a study to enable a robust detection of outliers
      between clinical sites. Conclusion The new model will be integrated into
      the current dashboard designed for clinical Quality Program Leads. This
      approach reduces the need for on-site audits, shifting focus from source
      data verification (SDV) to pre-identified, higher risk areas. It will
      enhance further quality assurance activities for safety reporting from
      clinical trials and generate quality evidence during pre-approval
      inspections.

    title: Long-read isoform sequencing reveals tissue-specific isoform expression
      between active and hibernating brown bears (Ursus arctos)
    category: genomics
    abstract: Understanding hibernation in brown bears (Ursus arctos) can provide
      insight into many human diseases. During hibernation, brown bears
      experience states of insulin resistance, physical inactivity, extreme
      bradycardia, obesity, and the absence of urine production. These states
      closely mimic human diseases such as type 2 diabetes, muscle atrophy,
      renal and heart failure, cachexia, and obesity. The reversibility of these
      states from hibernation to active season allows for the identification of
      novel mediators with possible therapeutic value for humans. Recent studies
      have identified genes and pathways that are differentially expressed
      between active and hibernation seasons. However, little is known about the
      role of differential expression of gene isoforms on hibernation
      physiology. To identify both distinct and novel mRNA isoforms, we
      performed full-length RNA-sequencing (Iso-Seq) on three tissue types from
      three individuals sampled during both active and hibernation seasons. We
      combined the long-read data with the reference annotation for an improved
      transcriptome and mapped RNA-seq data from six individuals to the improved
      transcriptome to quantify differential isoform usage between tissues and
      seasons. We identified differentially expressed isoforms in all study
      tissues and showed that adipose has a high level of differential isoform
      usage with isoform switching, regardless of whether the genes were
      differentially expressed. Our analyses provide a comprehensive evaluation
      of isoform usage between active and hibernation states, revealing that
      differential isoform usage, even in the absence of differential gene
      expression, is an important mechanism for modulating genes during
      hibernation. These findings demonstrate the value of isoform expression
      studies and will serve as the basis for deeper exploration into
      hibernation biology.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

      Results for the not-previously-infected group are barely
      presented/summarized. Without a calendar of absolute case counts, it is
      very difficult to get an idea of the real infection rate. I gave it a
      shot, using the relative plot in Figure 3. More at blog link.


      <b>Not previously PCR-confirmed-infected infection rate: 2,154 / 49,652 = 4.3%</b>

      -Completely Vaccinated infection rate: 15 / 28836 = 0.05%

      -Unvaccinated / Incompletely Vaccinated infection rate: 2,139 / 49,652 = 4.3%

      -Estimated Day 0 - 80 U/IV infection rate in 150-day units: (1620/49652)(15/8) = 6.1%

      -Estimated Day 80 - 150 U/IV infection rate in 150-day units: (529/21,332)(15/7) = 5.3%

      -Estimated Day 0 - 150 U/IV real infection rate (1620/49652) + (529/21,332) = 5.7%

    title: "Detection and Quantification of Infectious Severe Acute Respiratory
      Coronavirus-2 in Diverse Clinical and Environmental Samples from Infected
      Patients: Evidence to Support Respiratory Droplet, and Direct and Indirect
      Contact as Significant Modes of Transmission"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Few studies have assessed for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in multiple types
      of clinical and environmental samples. In almost 500 samples from 75
      hospitalized and community cases, we detected infectious virus with
      quantitative burdens varying from 5.0 plaque-forming units/mL (PFU/mL) up
      to 1.0x106 PFU/mL in clinical specimens and up to 1.3x106 PFU/mL on
      fomites including facial tissues, nasal prongs, call bells/cell phones,
      dentures, and sputum deposits with confirmation by plaque morphology, PCR,
      immunohistochemistry, and sequencing. Expectorated sputum samples had the
      highest percentage of positive samples and virus titers (71%, 2.9x102 to
      5.2x105 PFU/mL), followed by saliva (58%, 10 to 4.6x104 PFU/mL), and cough
      samples without sputum (19%, 5 to 1.9x103 PFU/mL). We also detected
      infectious SARS-CoV-2 from patients' hands (28%, 60 to 2.3x102 PFU/mL) but
      no infectious virus was found in continuous speech samples despite finding
      high levels of infectious virus in the associated nasopharynx, throat, or
      saliva specimens. We demonstrated infectious virus stability in clinical
      samples, including those dried for prolonged periods of time. Infectious
      virus correlated with time since symptom onset with no detection after 7-8
      days in immunocompetent hosts and with N-gene based Ct values [&le;]25
      significantly predictive of yielding plaques in culture. One PFU was
      associated with ~105 copies of N gene RNA across a diversity of samples
      and times from symptom onset. Clinical salivary isolates caused illness in
      a hamster model with a minimum infectious dose of [&le;]14 PFU/mL. Our
      findings of high quantitative burdens of infectious virus, stability even
      with drying, and a very low minimal infectious dose suggest multiple modes
      of transmission are exploited by SARS-CoV-2, including direct contact,
      large respiratory droplet, and fomite transmission and in the context of a
      high binding avidity to human cellular receptors, offer an explanation of
      the high contagiousness of this virus.

      The conclusions on cough samples, sputum, nasal secretions, hands, and
      high-touch surfaces seem sound, but I do not agree that this study can
      rule out speech as a source of virus because the sampling method was not
      appropriate for collecting aerosols (which might carry virus) generated by
      speech. Subjects spoke into a 18x19 cm or 27x27 cm polyethylene bag, to
      which "2 to 5 mL of DMEM+ was added and residual air was expelled." First,
      the ~1 L volume of air sampled, representing 1-2 breaths worth, is orders
      of magnitude too small to capture enough viruses to detect. Second, the
      act of expelling the air would push almost all aerosols out of the bag. An
      analogy is that it's like trying to catch a fish by dipping a hula hoop
      into the water. The authors should consider removing this portion of the
      study from the manuscript.

    title: SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern exhibit reduced sensitivity to live-virus
      neutralization in sera from CoronaVac vaccinees and naturally infected
      COVID-19 patients
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Recent surges in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) call for the
      need to evaluate levels of vaccine- and infection- induced SARS-CoV-2
      neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech, Beijing,
      China) is currently being used for mass vaccination in Thailand as well as
      other low-income countries. Three VOCs currently circulating within
      Thailand include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2
      (Delta) strains. We assessed NAb potency against the prototypic strain
      containing the original spike sequence (WT) compared to that against the 3
      VOCs using sera derived from a cohort of healthcare workers who received a
      full 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac. Sera from two other cohorts consisting
      of COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 and 2021 were
      evaluated for comparison. We found that, despite equally robust production
      of S1-RBD-binding IgG and 100% seropositivity, sera from both CoronaVac
      vaccinees and naturally infected individuals had significantly reduced
      neutralizing capacity against all 3 VOCs compared to WT. Strikingly, NAb
      titers against Alpha and Beta were comparable, but Delta appears to be
      significantly more refractory to NAbs in all groups. Our results may help
      inform on CoronaVac NAb-inducing capacity, which is a proxy for vaccine
      efficacy, in the context of the WT strain and 3 VOCs. Our results also
      have critical implications for public health decisionmakers who may need
      to maintain efficient mitigation strategies amid a potentially high risk
      for infection with VOCs even in those who have been previously infected.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to drive many important
      neuroscientific advances. However, progress in uncovering reproducible
      associations between individual differences in brain structure/function
      and behavioral phenotypes (e.g., cognition, mental health) may have been
      undermined by typical neuroimaging sample sizes (median N=25)1,2.
      Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study3
      (N=11,878), we estimated the effect sizes and reproducibility of these
      brain wide associations studies (BWAS) as a function of sample size. The
      very largest, replicable brain wide associations for univariate and
      multivariate methods were r=0.14 and r=0.34, respectively. In smaller
      samples, typical for brain wide association studies, irreproducible,
      inflated effect sizes were ubiquitous, no matter the method (univariate,
      multivariate). Until sample sizes started to approach consortium levels,
      BWAS were underpowered and statistical errors assured. Multiple factors
      contribute to replication failures4,5,6; here, we show that the pairing of
      small brain behavioral phenotype effect sizes with sampling variability is
      a key element in widespread BWAS replication failure. Brain behavioral
      phenotype associations stabilize and become more reproducible with sample
      sizes of N>2,000. While investigator initiated brain behavior research
      continues to generate hypotheses and propel innovation, large consortia
      are needed to usher in a new era of reproducible human brain wide
      association studies.

    title: Infectivity and immune escape of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant of interest
      Lambda
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: The newly described SARS-CoV-2 lineage C.37 was recently
      classified as a variant of interest by the WHO (Lambda variant) based on
      its high circulation rates in South American countries and the presence of
      critical mutations in the spike protein. The impact of such mutations in
      infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies are entirely
      unknown. Methods: We performed a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay
      and determined the impact of the Lambda variant on infectivity and immune
      escape using plasma samples from healthcare workers (HCW) from two centers
      in Santiago, Chile who received the two-doses scheme of the inactivated
      virus vaccine CoronaVac. Results: We observed an increased infectivity
      mediated by the Lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the
      D614G (lineage B) or the Alpha and Gamma variants. Compared to the Wild
      type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the Lambda
      variant while it was 2.33-fold for the Gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the
      Alpha variant. Conclusions: Our results indicate that mutations present in
      the spike protein of the Lambda variant of interest confer increased
      infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by
      CoronaVac. These data reinforce the idea that massive vaccination
      campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation must be
      accompanied by strict genomic surveillance allowing the identification of
      new isolates carrying spike mutations and immunology studies aimed to
      determine the impact of these mutations in immune escape and vaccines
      breakthrough."

    title: "Diet quality and risk and severity of COVID-19: a prospective cohort
      study"
    category: nutrition
    abstract: "Objective: Poor metabolic health and certain lifestyle factors have
      been associated with risk and severity of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19), but data for diet are lacking. We aimed to investigate the
      association of diet quality with risk and severity of COVID-19 and its
      intersection with socioeconomic deprivation. Design: We used data from
      592,571 participants of the smartphone-based COVID Symptom Study. Diet
      quality was assessed using a healthful plant-based diet score, which
      emphasizes healthy plant foods such as fruits or vegetables. Multivariable
      Cox models were fitted to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence
      intervals (95% CI) for COVID-19 risk and severity defined using a
      validated symptom-based algorithm or hospitalization with oxygen support,
      respectively. Results: Over 3,886,274 person-months of follow-up, 31,815
      COVID-19 cases were documented. Compared with individuals in the lowest
      quartile of the diet score, high diet quality was associated with lower
      risk of COVID-19 (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) and severe COVID-19 (HR,
      0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74). The joint association of low diet quality and
      increased deprivation on COVID-19 risk was higher than the sum of the risk
      associated with each factor alone (Pinteraction=0.005). The corresponding
      absolute excess rate for lowest vs highest quartile of diet score was 22.5
      (95% CI, 18.8-26.3) and 40.8 (95% CI, 31.7-49.8; 10,000 person-months)
      among persons living in areas with low and high deprivation, respectively.
      Conclusions: A dietary pattern characterized by healthy plant-based foods
      was associated with lower risk and severity of COVID-19. These association
      may be particularly evident among individuals living in areas with higher
      socioeconomic deprivation."

      @Hugo - you asked "We should consider if we want to review studies that do
      not use hPDI in the future?"

      Could you explain that question please? I've read it a few times and cannot understand whether you are making a point or making an enquiry.

    title: Practical Indicators for Risk of Airborne Transmission in Shared Indoor
      Environments and their application to COVID-19 Outbreaks
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Some infectious diseases, including COVID-19, can be transmitted via
      aerosols that are emitted by an infectious person and inhaled by
      susceptible individuals. Although physical distancing effectively reduces
      short-range airborne transmission, many infections have occurred when
      sharing room air despite maintaining distancing. We propose two simple
      parameters as indicators of infection risk for this situation. They
      combine the key factors that control airborne disease transmission
      indoors: virus-containing aerosol generation rate, breathing flow rate,
      masking and its quality, ventilation and air cleaning rates, number of
      occupants, and duration of exposure. COVID-19 outbreaks show a clear trend
      in relation to these parameters that is consistent with an airborne
      infection model, supporting the importance of airborne transmission for
      these outbreaks. The observed trends of outbreak size vs. risk parameters
      allow us to recommend values of the parameters to minimize COVID-19 indoor
      infection risk. All of the pre-pandemic spaces are in a regime where they
      are highly sensitive to mitigation efforts. Measles outbreaks occur at
      much lower risk parameter values than COVID-19, while tuberculosis
      outbreaks are observed at much higher risk parameter values. Since both
      diseases are accepted as airborne, the fact that COVID-19 is less
      contagious than measles does not rule out airborne transmission. It is
      important that future outbreak reports include ventilation information, to
      allow expanding our knowledge of the circumstances conducive to airborne
      transmission of different diseases."

      I reviewed the spreadhseet and replicated the computations in different
      software for both analysis (R) and visualisation (PowerBI, Tableau). In
      all cases the formulae seems correct and consistent.


      I've been able to follow the modelling reasoning (is not complicated) and check the referenced sources. It seems consistent.

    title: Analyzing the U.S. Post-marketing safety surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Background: Since December 2020, three COVID-19 vaccines have been
      authorized in the United States (U.S.) and were proceeded by large
      immunization programs. The aim of this study was to characterize the U.S.
      post-marketing safety (PMS) profiles of these vaccines with an in-depth
      analysis of mortality data. Methods: This was a retrospective database
      analysis study. Details of the U.S. PMS reports (15 December 2020 to 19
      March 2021) of the three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen
      Ad26.COV2.S) were retrieved from the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
      System (VAERS). A descriptive analysis was conducted to characterize the
      reported adverse events (AEs). A comparative (Pfizer-BioNTech vs. Moderna)
      analysis of mortality was conducted. The mean count ratio of death between
      the two vaccines was estimated using a negative binomial regression model
      adjusting for the measured confounders. Results: A total of 44,451 AE
      reports were retrieved (corresponding to 0.05% of the U.S. population who
      received at least one dose). The most commonly reported AEs were injection
      site reactions (30.4% of the reports), pain (reported in 26.7% of the
      reports), and headache (18.6% of the reports). Serious AEs were reported
      in only 14.6% of the reports with 4,108 hospitalizations. The total number
      of deaths was 1,919 with a mean count ratio of Moderna (n=997) vs.
      Pfizer-BioNTech (n=899) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.33).
      Conclusions: The vast majority of PMS AEs in the U.S. were non-serious,
      and the number of serious AEs is very low given the total number of
      vaccinated U.S. population."

      The VAERS reported death toll is now almost 11,000.  



      In 2010 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded a million-dollar grant to the Harvard Medical School to investigate the accuracy of the reporting. Their report concluded that “Fewer than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported by the VAERS System.



      https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf



      As of July 16, according to VAERS, more people have died from the Covid-19 vaccinations than from all other vaccines in the previous 25 years combined. I wonder how many people have to die before the AEs become "serious"?

    category: microbiology
    first_posted: 2021-05-09
    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant was first identified in the
      state of Maharashtra in late 2020 and has spread throughout India,
      displacing the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant and other pre-existing lineages.
      Mathematical modelling indicates that the growth advantage is most likely
      explained by a combination of increased transmissibility and immune
      evasion. Indeed in vitro, the delta variant is less sensitive to
      neutralising antibodies in sera from recovered individuals, with higher
      replication efficiency as compared to the Alpha variant. In an analysis of
      vaccine breakthrough in over 100 healthcare workers across three centres
      in India, the Delta variant not only dominates vaccine-breakthrough
      infections with higher respiratory viral loads compared to non-delta
      infections (Ct value of 16.5 versus 19), but also generates greater
      transmission between HCW as compared to B.1.1.7 or B.1.617.1 (mean cluster
      size 1.1 versus 3.3 p=0.03). In vitro, the Delta variant shows 8 fold
      approximately reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies compared
      to wild type Wuhan-1 bearing D614G. Serum neutralising titres against the
      SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant were significantly lower in participants
      vaccinated with ChadOx-1 as compared to BNT162b2 (GMT 3372 versus 654,
      p<0001). These combined epidemiological and in vitro data indicate that
      the dominance of the Delta variant in India has been most likely driven by
      a combination of evasion of neutralising antibodies in previously infected
      individuals and increased virus infectivity. Whilst severe disease in
      fully vaccinated HCW was rare, breakthrough transmission clusters in
      hospitals associated with the Delta variant are concerning and indicate
      that infection control measures need continue in the post-vaccination era.

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

      I agree with you, statistics is a valid science and I grant that you
      collected the data fairly.  But even if your numbers and methods are
      immaculate; the strongest conclusion you can reach is that there was a
      correlation between HCQ and survival in a small cohort over a year ago
      (btw, ventilation management is much different now).  If your paper had
      been submitted 15 months ago; the medical community would have been right
      in asking for some RCTs.  And in fact, there have been multiple well run
      trials done over the past year; none show any clear benefit.


      The big concern (and one that you may not be responsible for) is how some in the media have reported your results.  A commentator on a major network concluded his story with a shrug of the shoulders and said,  "See, Trump was right".  As we are seeing now with the mortality rates among the unvaccinated vs vaccinated; believing disinformation is a risk factor for hospitalization and death. I just heard a news source touting new evidence about Ivermectin.  Again, there have been multiple negative RCTs a few clicks away that are available to anyone.


      I ask you on this public forum;  do you believe, in light of current science, that HCQ is beneficial in the treatment of Covid-19?

    title: Estimating vaccine efficacy against transmission via effect on viral load
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Determining policies to end the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will require an
      understanding of the efficacy and effectiveness (hereafter, efficacy) of
      vaccines. Beyond the efficacy against severe disease and symptomatic and
      asymptomatic infection, understanding vaccine efficacy against
      transmission will help model epidemic trajectory and determine appropriate
      control measures. Recent studies have proposed using random virologic
      testing in individual randomized controlled trials to improve estimation
      of vaccine efficacy against infection. We propose to further use the viral
      load measures from these tests to estimate efficacy against transmission.
      This estimation requires a model of the relationship between viral load
      and transmissibility and assumptions about the vaccine effect on
      transmission and the progress of the epidemic. We describe these key
      assumptions, potential violations of them, and solutions that can be
      implemented to mitigate these violations. Assessing these assumptions and
      implementing this random sampling, with viral load measures, will enable
      better estimation of the crucial measure of vaccine efficacy against
      transmission.

    title: Interpreting vaccine efficacy trial results for infection and transmission
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown high efficacy of
      multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), and recent
      studies have shown the vaccines are also effective against infection.
      Evidence for the effect of each of these vaccines on ability to transmit
      the virus is also beginning to emerge. We describe an approach to estimate
      these vaccines' effects on viral positivity, a prevalence measure which
      under the reasonable assumption that vaccinated individuals who become
      infected are no more infectious than unvaccinated individuals forms a
      lower bound on efficacy against transmission. Specifically, we recommend
      separate analysis of positive tests triggered by symptoms (usually the
      primary outcome) and cross-sectional prevalence of positive tests obtained
      regardless of symptoms. The odds ratio of carriage for vaccine vs. placebo
      provides an unbiased estimate of vaccine effectiveness against viral
      positivity, under certain assumptions, and we show through simulations
      that likely departures from these assumptions will only modestly bias this
      estimate. Applying this approach to published data from the RCT of the
      Moderna vaccine, we estimate that one dose of vaccine reduces the
      potential for transmission by at least 61%, possibly considerably more. We
      describe how these approaches can be translated into observational studies
      of vaccine effectiveness.

    raw_message: Unless "efficacy" and "positivity" are more clearly defined, this
      is meaningless.  Eg, using PCR amplification of 35 or greater for
      diagnosis then using an amplification of 24 for "transmission" would
      greatly favor vaccine-related prevention of transmission but would be faux
      data.  Also, unless there is randomization for vitamin D levels -- shown
      to impair virulence if > 36 ng/mL -- the data is also meaningless.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Observational Study on 255 Mechanically Ventilated Covid Patients at the
      Beginning of the USA Pandemic
    category: pharmacology-and-therapeutics
    abstract: "Abstract Introduction: This observational study looked at 255 COVID19
      patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during the
      first two months of the US pandemic. Through comprehensive, longitudinal
      evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better
      describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation.
      Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication
      administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and
      organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM
      data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were
      incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results:
      By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common
      pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and
      obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical
      status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers
      of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight
      range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted
      HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did
      not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion:
      This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors,
      prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few
      variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using
      new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and
      AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of
      absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration
      [&ge;]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring
      Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated
      with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to
      HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The
      weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than
      those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the
      weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study
      therapeutics more thoughtfully."

    title: "Ivermectin as a potential treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19: A
      double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: >-
      ObjectiveIvermectin has been suggested as a treatment for COVID-19.This
      randomised control trial was conducted to test the efficacy of Ivermectin
      in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19.


      DesignParallel, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial Setting: A tertiary care dedicated COVID-19 hospital in Bihar, India


      ParticipantsAdult patients (> 18 years) admitted with mild to moderate COVID 19 disease (saturation > 90% on room air, respiratory rate < 30 and no features of shock) with no contraindications to ivermectin and willing to participate in the study


      InterventionPatients in the intervention arm were given ivermectin 12 mg on day 1 and day 2 of admission. Patients in the placebo arm were given identical looking placebo tablets. Rest of the treatment was continued as per the existing protocol and the clinical judgment of the treating teams.


      Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measure was a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 6 of admission. The secondary outcome measures were symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality.


      ResultsA total of 115 patients were enrolled for the study of which 112 were included in the final analysis. Of them, 55 were randomised to the intervention arm while 57 were randomised to the placebo arm. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two arms. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 between the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two groups in most of the secondary outcome measures, viz. symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, while there was no in-hospital mortality in the intervention arm, there were 4 deaths in the placebo arm. As a result, all patients in the intervention arm (n=56) were successfully discharged as compared to 93.1% (n=54/58) in the placebo arm (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2, p=0.019).


      ConclusionThere was no difference in the primary outcome i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 of admission with the use of ivermectin. However, a significantly higher proportion of patients were discharged alive from the hospital when they received ivermectin.


      Strengths and Limitations of the StudyO_LIThis study was randomised and double blind, thereby minimizing the chance of bias.

      C_LIO_LIAll outcome measures except symptom status on day 6 were objective and placebo control was used for comparison.

      C_LIO_LIOnly single repeat RT-PCR was done. So median time to viral clearance in the two groups could not be calculated.

      C_LIO_LISevere cases were not included in the study.

    title: "SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 induces fibrin(ogen) resistant to
      fibrinolysis: Implications for microclot formation in COVID-19"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) -induced
      infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is
      characterized by unprecedented clinical pathologies. One of the most
      important pathologies, is hypercoagulation and microclots in the lungs of
      patients. Here we study the effect of isolated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1
      subunit as potential inflammagen sui generis. Using scanning electron and
      fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the
      potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen)
      directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma
      (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass
      spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy
      PPP, it results in structural changes to {beta} and {gamma} fibrin(ogen),
      complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant
      to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest
      that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute
      to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause
      substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result
      in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in
      plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. This observation may have important
      clinical relevance in the treatment of hypercoagulability in COVID-19
      patients.

    title: Clonally expanded virus-specific CD8 T cells acquire diverse
      transcriptional phenotypes during acute, chronic, and latent infections

    abstract: CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in the control and resolution of
      viral infections and can adopt a wide range of phenotypes and effector
      functions depending on the inflammatory context and the duration and
      extent of antigen exposure. Similarly, viral infections can exert diverse
      selective pressures on populations of clonally related T cells. Technical
      limitations have nevertheless made it challenging to investigate the
      relationship between clonal selection and transcriptional phenotypes of
      virus-specific T cells. We therefore performed single-cell T cell receptor
      (TCR) repertoire and transcriptome sequencing of virus-specific CD8 T
      cells in murine models of acute, chronic and latent infection. We observed
      clear infection-specific populations corresponding to memory, effector,
      exhausted, and inflationary phenotypes. We further uncovered a
      mouse-specific and polyclonal T cell response, despite all T cells sharing
      specificity to a single viral epitope, which was accompanied by
      stereotypic TCR germline gene usage in all three infection types.
      Persistent antigen exposure during chronic and latent viral infections
      resulted in a higher proportion of clonally expanded T cells relative to
      acute infection. We furthermore observed a relationship between
      transcriptional heterogeneity and clonal expansion for all three
      infections, with highly expanded clones having distinct transcriptional
      phenotypes relative to lowly expanded clones. Finally, we developed and
      utilized a bioinformatic pipeline integrating pseudotime and clonality,
      termed Clonotyme, to further support a model in which expanded
      virus-specific CD8+ T cells adopt heterogenic, yet preferentially,
      effector-like phenotypes. Together our work relates clonal selection to
      gene expression in the context of viral infection and further provides a
      dataset and accompanying software for the immunological community.

    title: "Diurnal brain temperature rhythms and mortality after brain injury: a
      prospective and retrospective cohort study"
    category: intensive-care-and-critical-care-medicine
    abstract: "Objective: To determine the clinical relevance of brain temperature
      (TBr) variation in patients after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Design:
      Cohort study with prospective (healthy participant) and retrospective (TBI
      patient) arms. Setting: Single neuroimaging site in the UK (prospective
      arm); intensive care sites contributing to the Collaborative European
      NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) High Resolution ICU
      (HR ICU) Sub-Study (retrospective arm). Participants: 40 healthy adults
      aged 20-40 years recruited for non-invasive brain thermometry and all
      patients up to May 2020 that had TBr measured directly and were not
      subjected to Targeted Temperature Management (TTM). Main outcome measures:
      A diurnal change in TBr (healthy participants); death in intensive care
      (patients). Results: In healthy participants, mean TBr (38.5 SD
      0.4{degrees}C) was higher than oral temperature (36.0 SD 0.5{degrees}C),
      and 0.36{degrees}C higher in luteal females relative to follicular females
      and males (95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.55, P=0.0006 and 0.23 to
      0.49, P<0.0001, respectively). TBr increased with age, most notably in
      deep brain regions (0.6{degrees}C over 20 years; 0.11 to 1.07, P=0.0002).
      The mean maximal spatial TBr range was 2.41 (SD 0.46){degrees}C, with
      highest temperatures in the thalamus. TBr varied significantly by time of
      day, especially in deep brain regions (0.86{degrees}C ; 0.37 to 1.26,
      P=0.0001), and was lowest in the late evening. Diurnal TBr in cortical
      white matter across participants ranged from 37.0 to 40.3{degrees}C. In
      TBI patients (n=114), mean TBr (38.5 SD 0.8{degrees}C) was significantly
      higher than body temperature (TBo 37.5 SD 0.5{degrees}C ; P<0.0001) and
      ranged from 32.6 to 42.3{degrees}C. Only 25/110 patients displayed a
      diurnal temperature rhythm; TBr amplitude was reduced in older patients
      (P=0.018), and 25/113 patients died in intensive care. Lack of a daily TBr
      rhythm, or an age increase of 10 years, increased the odds of death
      12-fold and 11-fold, respectively (OR for death with rhythm 0.09; 0.01 to
      0.84, P=0.035 and for death with ageing by 1 year 1.10; 1.05 to 1.16,
      P=0.0002). Mean TBr was positively associated with survival (OR for death
      0.45 for 1{degrees}C increase; 0.21 to 0.96, P=0.040). Conclusions:
      Healthy TBr exceeds TBo and varies by sex, age, menstrual cycle, brain
      region, and time of day. Our 4-dimensional reference resource for healthy
      TBr can guide interpretation of TBr data in multiple clinical settings.
      Daily temperature variation is frequently disrupted or absent in TBI
      patients, in which TBr variation is of greater prognostic use than
      absolute TBr. Older TBI patients lacking a daily TBr rhythm are at
      greatest risk of death in intensive care. Appropriately controlled trials
      are needed to confirm the predictive power of TBr rhythmicity in relation
      to patient outcome, as well as the clinical utility of TTM protocols in
      brain-injured patients. Registration: UK CRN NIHR CPMS 42644;
      ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02210221."

    title: Transmission event of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant reveals multiple vaccine
      breakthrough infections
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: >-
      ImportanceVaccine breakthrough by an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant poses a
      great risk to global public health.


      ObjectiveTo determine the SARS-CoV-2 variant responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough.


      DesignNasopharyngeal swabs from suspected vaccine breakthrough cases were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR for Wuhan-Hu1 and Alpha variant. Positive samples were then sequenced by Swift Normalase Amplicon Panels to determine the causal variant.


      SettingTransmission event occurred at events surrounding a wedding outside of Houston, TX. Two patients from India, likely transmitted the Delta variant to other guests.


      ParticipantsFollowing a positive SARS-CoV-2 qPCR test at a third-party site, six fully vaccinated patients were investigated. Three males and three females ranged from 53 to 69 years old. One patient suffered from diabetes while three others were classified as overweight. No significant other comorbidities were identified. None of the patients had a history of failed vaccination.


      Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhich SARS-CoV-2 variant is responsible for 6 cases of vaccine breakthrough, one interventional monoclonal antibody treatment, and one death?


      FindingsViral sequencing revealed 6 vaccinated patients were infected with the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. With no histories of vaccine breakthrough, this suggests Delta variant may possess immune evasion in patients that received the Pfizer BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, and Covaxin BBV152.


      MeaningDelta variant may pose the highest risk out of any currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, with increased transmissibility over Alpha variant and possible vaccine breakthrough.

      I am myself fully vaccinated with Covaxin with no side effects and have an
      IGG antibody score of 150.00 which is apparently enough as per many
      studies. 

      While vaccinating with Inactivated virus vaccines one should maintain proper isolation from those who're not vaccinated with it. I don't think travelling between the dose 1 and dose 2+ 14 days was a good idea. Vaccines work but they take time in changing environment

    title: Optimal vaccination strategies for COVID-19 based on dynamical social
      networks with real-time updating
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Vaccination strategy is crucial in fighting against the COVID-19
      pandemic. Since the supply is limited, contact network-based interventions
      can be most powerful to set an optimal strategy by identifying high-risk
      individuals or communities. However, due to the high dimension, only
      partial and noisy network information can be available in practice,
      especially for dynamical systems where the contact networks are highly
      time-variant. Furthermore, numerous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 impact
      considerably the current infectious probability, requiring real-time
      network updating algorithms. In this study, we propose a sequential
      network updating approach based on data assimilation techniques to combine
      different sources of temporal information. We then prioritise the
      individuals with high-degree or high-centrality, obtained from the
      assimilated networks, for vaccination. The assimilation-based approach is
      compared with the standard method (based on partially observed networks)
      and a random selection strategy in terms of vaccination effectiveness in a
      SIR model. The numerical comparison is first carried out using real-world
      face-to-face dynamical networks collected in a high school, following by
      sequential multi-layer networks, generated relying on the Barabasi-Albert
      model emulating the department of Computing at Imperial College London in
      the UK as an example.

      Hi, I'm one of the authors of [49].



      I will make the following suggestions:



      1- I see that medical doctors in several countries (India, China, South Korea etc.) are repurposing drugs and nutraceuticals and they are making huge strides on COVID-19 treatment guidelines. It will for sure be interesting to inform the general public about these possibilities, even if these possibilities are not currently acknowledged by organizations such as the WHO.



      2- Many of the current COVID-19 vaccines are not sterilizing and thus cannot block transmission efficiently. Virus spread may vary due to different vaccine platforms.



      3- Vaccines for respiratory viruses are known to have lower immunogenicity on older age cohorts and to have also a vanishing protection against infection and symptomatic infection. This could be added to the model.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: "Vaccine escape in a heterogeneous population: insights for SARS-CoV-2
      from a simple model"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: As a counter measure to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there has been swift
      development and clinical trial assessment of candidate vaccines, with
      subsequent deployment as part of mass vaccination campaigns. However, the
      SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the ability to mutate and develop
      variants, which can modify epidemiological properties and potentially also
      the effectiveness of vaccines. The widespread deployment of highly
      effective vaccines may rapidly exert selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2
      virus directed towards mutations that escape the vaccine induced immune
      response. This is particularly concerning whilst infection is widespread.
      By developing and analysing a mathematical model of two population
      groupings with differing vulnerability and contact rates, we explore the
      impact of the deployment of vaccine amongst the population on R, cases,
      disease abundance and vaccine escape pressure. The results from this model
      illustrate two insights (i) vaccination aimed at reducing prevalence could
      be more effective at reducing disease than directly vaccinating the
      vulnerable; (ii) the highest risk for vaccine escape can occur at
      intermediate levels of vaccination. This work demonstrates a key principle
      that the careful targeting of vaccines towards particular population
      groups could reduce disease as much as possible whilst limiting the risk
      of vaccine escape.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    abstract: Gene-environment correlations can bias associations between genetic
      variants and complex traits in genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
      Here, we control for geographic sources of gene-environment correlation in
      GWASs on 56 complex traits (N=69,772-271,457). Controlling for geographic
      region significantly decreases heritability signals for SES-related
      traits, most strongly for educational attainment and income, indicating
      that socio-economic differences between regions induce gene-environment
      correlations that become part of the polygenic signal. For most other
      complex traits investigated, genetic correlations with educational
      attainment and income are significantly reduced, most significantly for
      traits related to BMI, sedentary behavior, and substance use. Controlling
      for current address has greater impact on the polygenic signal than birth
      place, suggesting both active and passive sources of gene-environment
      correlations. Our results show that societal sources of social
      stratification that extend beyond families introduce regional-level
      gene-environment correlations that affect GWAS results.

    title: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is not significantly linked to
      COVID-19 vaccines or non-COVID vaccines in a large multi-state US health
      system
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been reported in a small
      number of individuals who have received the mRNA vaccines or the
      adenoviral vector vaccines for COVID-19 in the US and Europe. Continued
      pharmacovigilance is integral to mitigating the risk of rare adverse
      events that clinical trials are underpowered to detect, however, these
      anecdotal reports have led to the pause or withdrawal of some vaccines in
      many jurisdictions and exacerbated vaccine hesitancy at a critical moment
      in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the
      frequencies of CVST seen among individuals who received FDA-authorized
      COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n =
      36,350 doses) and Johnson & Johnson - J&J (n = 1,745 doses), and among
      individuals receiving one of 10 FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n =
      771,805 doses). Comparing the incidence rates of CVST in 30-day time
      windows before and after vaccination, we found no statistically
      significant differences for the COVID-19 vaccines or any other vaccines
      studied in this population. In total, we observed 3 cases of CVST within
      the 30 days following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination (2 females, 1 male; Ages
      (years): [79, 80, 84]), including one individual with a prior history of
      thrombosis and another individual with recent trauma in the past 30 days.
      We did not observe any cases of CVST among the patients receiving Moderna
      or J&J vaccines in this study population. We further found the baseline
      CVST incidence in the study population between 2017 and 2021 to be 45 to
      98 per million patient years. Overall, this real-world evidence-based
      study highlights that CVST is rare and is not significantly associated
      with COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, there is a need for a concerted
      international effort to monitor EHR data across diverse patient
      populations and to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms
      leading to these rare clotting events."

    title: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a cohort of 43,000 antibody-positive
      individuals followed for up to 35 weeks
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Reinfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been documented, raising public health
      concerns. Risk and incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection were assessed
      in a large cohort of antibody-positive persons in Qatar. Methods: All
      SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons with a PCR-positive swab [&ge;]14
      days after the first-positive antibody test were individually investigated
      for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for
      paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Incidence of reinfection
      was compared to incidence of infection in the complement cohort of those
      antibody-negative. Results: Among 43,044 anti-SARS-CoV-2 positive persons
      who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314
      individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab [&ge;]14 days after
      the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had
      supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next
      investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the
      viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the risk of reinfection was
      estimated at 0.10% (95% CI: 0.08-0.11%). The incidence rate of reinfection
      was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78).
      Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any
      evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up.
      Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons
      followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0-45.6), risk of infection was
      estimated at 2.15% (95% CI: 2.08-2.22%) and incidence rate of infection
      was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22-14.14).
      Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2%
      (95% CI: 94.1-96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary
      infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none
      were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed
      incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact
      tracing. Conclusions: Reinfection is rare. Natural infection appears to
      elicit strong protection against reinfection with an efficacy ~95% for at
      least seven months."

    title: Universal prediction of cell cycle position using transfer learning
    category: genomics
    abstract: The cell cycle is a highly conserved, continuous process which
      controls faithful replication and division of cells. Single-cell
      technologies have enabled increasingly precise measurements of the cell
      cycle as both as a biological process of interest and as a possible
      confounding factor. Despite its importance and conservation, there is no
      universally applicable approach to infer position in the cell cycle with
      high-resolution from single-cell RNA-seq data. Here, we present tricycle,
      an R/Bioconductor package, to address this challenge by leveraging key
      features of the biology of the cell cycle, the mathematical properties of
      principal component analysis of periodic functions, and the ubiquitous
      applicability of transfer learning. We show that tricycle can predict any
      cells position in the cell cycle regardless of the cell type, species of
      origin, and even sequencing assay. The accuracy of tricycle compares
      favorably to gold-standard experimental assays which generally require
      specialized measurements in specifically constructed in vitro systems.
      Unlike gold-standard assays, tricycle is easily applicable to any
      single-cell RNA-seq dataset. Tricycle is highly scalable, universally
      accurate, and eminently pertinent for atlas-level data.

      A Review of Zheng et al, Universal prediction of cell cycle position using
      transfer learning, by Matthew Stephens


      This paper provides a new approach (tricycle) for predicting the

      position of a cell in the cell cycle. The approach claims to work

      regardless of cell type, species and sequencing assay.

      There are several things to like about the paper. In particular,

      the tricycle method is very

      simple: i) compute the first two PCs on

      500 annotated cell-cycle genes in a data set where cell cycle

      is the primary source of variation; ii) project

      any future observations to this 2-d embedding and compute

      the polar angle to predict its cell cycle

      position. Further, the empirical results are promising.

      At the same time I think the paper

      could be substantially improved by removing or

      reducing some of the less innovative parts, toning down some of the rhetoric,

      and focussing on the most convincing empirical results. My comments expand

      on these suggestions.


      Main comments:


      1. I found most of the material on PCA not to be

      especially novel or interesting. The use of PCA to determine cell cycle

      position has a long history (including many papers cited here),

      and existing mathematical results already go far beyond

      the analysis presented here. The behavior of PCA on cyclic phenomena

      is much more general than presented here, and does not rely on sinusoidal

      functions or "two distinct peaks" etc. Rather it stems

      from the result that cyclic phenomona lead to circulant covariance matrices,

      and all circulant matrices have the same eigenvectors:

      the columns of the discrete Fourier transform matrix. The result

      is that, when the covariance patterns primarily reflect cyclic phenomoena,

      the first two PCs will form a circle/ellipse.

      See Novembre and Stephens (2008) and references therein for further discussion.

      Figure 1 is useful for summarizing the method, but most of the other

      material could be condensed or removed and I think the paper would be improved because

      it would better focus on what is actually new and interesting, the tricycle

      method (currently not introduced until p6) and the empirical assessments of its performance.


      2. The paper left me asking myself this: what is the strongest empirical support that tricycle cell

      cycle assignments work in practice? To me, Fig 5 panels c and g are the most convincing, because they are quantitative

      comparisons with an alternative technology (and one that is often considered the

      "gold standard" in this area). I also liked the quantitative comparisons with other

      methods,  and it seems some of those might

      be worth including in the main text. In contrast, the results in Fig 4 are not

      quantitative, and overall not that compelling. The top row

      of panels are kind of useful in demonstrating you get something like a circle.

      but we don't actually know that this corresponds to cell cycle from this picture

      (unless I misunderstood, the colors are inferred, not known).

      And looking at the mPancreas results one might be tempted to use (-3,0) as the

      center of the circle, which would change computation of polar angle quite a bit.

      Is there reason to think that sticking with (0,0) is better? If so, any idea why does

      the circle show this shift? (Similar issues arise, to a lesser extent, with HippNPC).

      The Top2A results are, on their own, too noisy to be convincing -- why not show R2 plots for

      all cell-cycle genes (which could be contrasted with non-cell-cycle genes, and also compared

      with other methods). And as far as I can

      see Fig 4c is, at best, only interesting once one is convinced that the cell cycle

      is being correctly inferred -- nothing here to say that the cell cycle inferences are accurate.

      To be clear, I'm not saying the method does not generalize well across

      data sets; I'm saying that the evidence for this needs to be more clearly presented.



      3. A less fundamental issue: I don't really think describing this as an example of "transfer learning"

      is helpful. Indeed it is not even clear to me it is accurate.

      For example, in the cited Pan et al 2008, they describe the transfer

      learning problem as follows: "In a transfer learning setting, some labeled data Dsrc are

      available in a source domain, while only unlabeled data Dtar

      are available in the target domain." That does not apply here - everything

      is based on unlabelled data.


      More generally, giving the approach a name like "transfer learning" seems to

      suggest that there is something going on to actually make this transfer

      from one dataset to another, or some deeper theoretical reason to think it should work

      --  but I don't believe either of these is true. You are just hoping

      that the PC weights learned in one (carefully chosen) data set will

      also work to capture cell cycle on other data sets.

      It isn't obvious in advance that this rather simple approach

      would work well, and the major contribution of the paper is to assess this
       empirically.


      4. The abstract is hyperbolic. "ubiquitous applicability of transfer learning";

      "can predict any cell's position in the cell cycle",

      "universally accurate", "eminently pertinent"...



      Minor:


      - p2 you introduce the term "cell cycle pseudotime" only to explain later that it is not really a time at all. Why not just go straight into "cell cycle position"

      or "cell cycle phase"? (Also, the term "wall time" may not be familiar to all readers?)


      -p5 left column: Figure 2d-> 2f?


      - p8, right column:  is "superficial" the right word here?


      - Some of the loess fits (eg Fig 2 d-f; Fig 4 panel b, especially mHippNPC) don't look visually very good. Is this

      just an artifact of having 0s, whose density is impossible to see due to overplotting, or is loess over-smoothing? Might trend filtering, as used in Hsiao et al, work better?

    title: Multi-omic profiling of primary mouse neutrophils reveals a pattern of
      sex and age-related functional regulation
    category: genomics
    abstract: >-
      Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in humans and
      constitute one of the first lines of defense in the innate immune
      response. Neutrophils are extremely short-lived cells, which survive less
      than a day after reaching terminal differentiation. Thus, little is known
      about how organismal aging, rather than the daily cellular aging process,
      may impact neutrophil biology. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests
      that both immunity and organismal aging are sex-dimorphic. Here, we
      describe a multi-omic resource of mouse primary bone marrow neutrophils
      from young and old female and male mice, at the transcriptomic,
      metabolomic and lipidomic levels. Importantly, we identify widespread
      age-related and sex-dimorphic regulation of 'omics' in neutrophils,
      specifically regulation of chromatin. Using machine-learning, we identify
      candidate molecular drivers of age-related and sex-dimorphic
      transcriptional regulation of neutrophils. We leverage our resource to
      predict increased levels/release of neutrophil elastase in male mice. To
      date, this dataset represents the largest multi-omics resource for the
      study of neutrophils across biological sex and ages. This resource
      identifies molecular states linked to neutrophil characteristics linked to
      organismal age or sex, which could be targeted to improve immune responses
      across individuals.

    title: Genetic basis and dual adaptive role of floral pigmentation in sunflowers
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: Variation in floral displays, both between and within species, has
      been long known to be shaped by the mutualistic interactions that plants
      establish with their pollinators. However, increasing evidence suggests
      that abiotic selection pressures influence floral diversity as well. Here
      we analyze the genetic and environmental factors that underlie patterns of
      floral pigmentation in wild sunflowers. While sunflower inflorescences
      appear invariably yellow to the human eye, they display extreme diversity
      for patterns of ultraviolet pigmentation, which are visible to most
      pollinators. We show that this diversity is largely controlled by
      cis-regulatory variation at a single MYB transcription factor, HaMYB111,
      through accumulation of UV-absorbing flavonol glycosides. As expected,
      different patterns of ultraviolet pigments in flowers have a strong effect
      on pollinator preferences. However, variation for floral ultraviolet
      patterns is also associated with environmental variables, especially
      relative humidity, across populations of wild sunflowers. Larger
      ultraviolet patterns, which are found in drier environments, limit
      transpiration, therefore reducing water loss. The dual role of floral UV
      patterns in pollination attraction and abiotic responses reveals the
      complex adaptive balance underlying the evolution of floral traits.

      Hi Nate, thank you! I am glad you found our manuscript interesting.


      1) As per you suggestion, we did check VPD, but there is not much correlation with floral UV patterns. What we see is that floral UV patterns in sunflowers are inversely correlated with both temperature and relative humidity, while VPD increases with temperature and decreases with relative humidity. Our interpretation is that in hot, humid places, preventing over-heating of the ligules through transpiration/evaporative cooling is a priority over reducing water loss (even if VDP might be similar to that of colder, drier places).


      2) We did measure flower and ligule size on a subset of ~700 individuals that were grown in the first of our common garden experiments, and there is plenty of variation in flower and ligule size, ligule shape and ligule number (that data is included in a recent paper, Todesco et al., Nature 2020). However, this variation is more difficult to interpret because inflorescence size is very well correlated with flowering time in wild sunflowers (plants that flower later are bigger, and bigger plants make bigger inflorescences). There was extensive variation in flowering time between populations of wild <i>H. annuus</i> in our common garden experiment, with plants flowering anywhere between 30 and more than 130 days after being transplanted. While we can control for when these plants flowered in our common garden, we don’t really know how flowering time in Vancouver translates to flowering time in the location of origin of these plants. Measuring flower/ligule size in situ would be much more informative, but we do not have that data.


      That said, there is some decent correlation, particularly between relative humidity and relative ligule size (that is, the size of the ligule relative to the size of the whole inflorescence), with plants coming from population with higher humidity having larger ligules. The correlation might be clearer for relative ligule size because it is be less likely to be affected by flowering time/plant size; we use ligule UV proportion (LUVp) to measure floral UV patterns instead of absolute measurements of UV bullseye size exactly for that reason. A previous study from our lab (in <i>H. argophyllus</i>, a different sunflower species) found that in a segregating population, all absolute measures of floral UV pigmentation (e.g. diameter of UV bullseye) mapped to a big flowering time QTL, while LUVp measurements mapped to different regions of the genome (incidentally, in the paper I mentioned before we also confirmed that that QTL in <i>H. argophyllus</i> is indeed due to a well-known flowering time regulator, which was part of a recent large introgression).

      To sum up, while there is some indication that sunflowers have smaller flowers/ligules in drier climates, it would take in-depth field studies to be able to say something with a modicum of certainty.

    title: Design considerations for workflow management systems use in production
      genomics research and the clinic
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: 'Background: The changing landscape of genomics research and clinical
      practice has created a need for computational pipelines capable of
      efficiently orchestrating complex analysis stages while handling large
      volumes of data across heterogeneous computational environments. Workflow
      Management Systems (WfMSs) are the software components employed to fill
      this gap. Results: This work provides an approach and systematic
      evaluation of key features of popular bioinformatics WfMSs in use today:
      Nextflow, CWL, and WDL and some of their executors, along with Swift/T, a
      workflow manager commonly used in high-scale physics applications. We
      employed two use cases: a variant-calling genomic pipeline and a
      scalability-testing framework, where both were run locally, on an HPC
      cluster, and in the cloud. This allowed for evaluation of those four WfMSs
      in terms of language expressiveness, modularity, scalability, robustness,
      reproducibility, interoperability, ease of development, along with
      adoption and usage in research labs and healthcare settings. This article
      is trying to answer, "which WfMS should be chosen for a given
      bioinformatics application regardless of analysis type?". Conclusions: The
      choice of a given WfMS is a function of both its intrinsic language and
      engine features. Within bioinformatics, where analysts are a mix of dry
      and wet lab scientists, the choice is also governed by collaborations and
      adoption within large consortia and technical support provided by the WfMS
      team/community. As the community and its needs continue to evolve along
      with computational infrastructure, WfMSs will also evolve, especially
      those with permissive licenses that allow commercial use. In much the same
      way as the dataflow paradigm and containerization are now well understood
      to be very useful in bioinformatics applications, we will continue to see
      innovations of tools and utilities for other purposes, like big data
      technologies, interoperability, and provenance.'

    title: The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 reprograms both adaptive and
      innate immune responses
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: The mRNA-based BNT162b2 vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech was the first
      registered COVID-19 vaccine and has been shown to be up to 95% effective
      in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections. Little is known about the broad
      effects of the new class of mRNA vaccines, especially whether they have
      combined effects on innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we
      confirmed that BNT162b2 vaccination of healthy individuals induced
      effective humoral and cellular immunity against several SARS-CoV-2
      variants. Interestingly, however, the BNT162b2 vaccine also modulated the
      production of inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells upon
      stimulation with both specific (SARS-CoV-2) and non-specific (viral,
      fungal and bacterial) stimuli. The response of innate immune cells to TLR4
      and TLR7/8 ligands was lower after BNT162b2 vaccination, while
      fungi-induced cytokine responses were stronger. In conclusion, the mRNA
      BNT162b2 vaccine induces complex functional reprogramming of innate immune
      responses, which should be considered in the development and use of this
      new class of vaccines.

      OK, authors, there are problems here. You don't have the sample numbers to
      make the claims you do, and your data do not bear it. 


      Interferon alpha effect you report here seems, from your own graphs, to be an artifact of changes between the first and the second dose, not between vaccine and lack of vaccine. I.e. you have a very minor shift up at t2, which makes the drop at t3 significant - but there is no actual effect between t1 and t3. 


      For TNFa data, the R848 seems to be based on one single patient who had a strong increase at t2 that declined in t3. The only significant observation that holds is the one with candida, which then brings up the problem of sampling (test enough things, and you'll get a result somewhere). You need to state your statistics much more clearly. 


      There is an possible trend here, but that trend a) needs to also be interpreted in the light of known post-viral effects on the innate immune system (such as e.g. those seen with post-influenza effects on bacterial resistance), and b) needs to stated as trend, not as a definite finding.

    abstract: During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a variety of mutations have
      been accumulated in the viral genome, and currently, four variants of
      concerns (VOCs) are considered as the hazardous SARS-CoV-2 variants to the
      human society1. The newly emerging VOC, the B.1.617.2/Delta variant,
      closely associates with a huge COVID-19 surge in India in Spring 20212.
      However, its virological property remains unclear. Here, we show that the
      B.1.617.2/Delta variant is highly fusogenic, and notably, more pathogenic
      than prototypic SARS-CoV-2 in infected hamsters. The P681R mutation in the
      spike protein, which is highly conserved in this lineage, facilitates the
      spike protein cleavage and enhances viral fusogenicity. Moreover, we
      demonstrate that the P681R-bearing virus exhibits higher pathogenicity
      than the parental virus. Our data suggest that the P681R mutation is a
      hallmark that characterizes the virological phenotype of the
      B.1.617.2/Delta variant and is closely associated with enhanced
      pathogenicity.

    title: "ShinyArchR.UiO: User-friendly, integrative and open-source tool for
      visualisation of single-cell ATAC-seq data using ArchR"
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: "Motivation: Mapping of chromatin accessibility landscapes in
      single-cells and the integration with gene expression enables a better
      understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms defining cell identities and
      cell-fate determination in development and disease. Generally, raw data
      generated from single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin
      sequencing (scATAC-seq) are deposited in reposito-ries that are
      inaccessible due to lack of in-depth knowledge of computational
      programming. Results: We have developed ShinyArchR.UiO, an R-based shiny
      app, that facilitates scATAC-seq data accessibility and visualisation in a
      user-friendly, interactive, and open-source web interface. ShinyArchR.UiO
      is a tool that can streamline collaborative efforts for interpretation of
      massive chro-matin accessible data and promotes open access data sharing
      for wider audiences."

    title: A new field instrument for leaf volatiles reveals an unexpected vertical
      profile of isoprenoid emission capacities in a tropical forest
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: "Both plant physiology and atmospheric chemistry are substantially
      altered by the emission of volatile isoprenoids (VI), such as isoprene and
      monoterpenes, from plant leaves. Yet, since gaining scientific attention
      in the 1950's, empirical research on leaf VI has been largely confined to
      laboratory experiments and atmospheric observations. Here, we introduce a
      new field instrument designed to bridge the scales from leaf to
      atmosphere, by enabling precision VI detection in real time from plants in
      their natural ecological setting. With a field campaign in the Brazilian
      Amazon, we reveal an unexpected distribution of leaf emission capacities
      (EC) across the vertical axis of the forest canopy, with EC peaking in the
      mid-canopy instead of the sun-exposed canopy surface, and high emissions
      occurring in understory specialist species. Compared to the simple
      interpretation that VI protect leaves from heat stress at the hot canopy
      surface, our results encourage a more nuanced view of the adaptive role of
      VI in plants. We infer that forest emissions to the atmosphere depend on
      the dynamic microenvironments imposed by canopy structure, and not simply
      on canopy surface conditions. We provide a new emissions inventory from 51
      tropical tree species, revealing moderate consistency in EC within
      taxonomic groups. Our self-contained, portable instrument provides
      real-time detection and live measurement feedback with precision and
      detection limits better than 0.5 nmol m-2leaf s-1. We call the instrument
      'PORCO' based on the gas detection method: photoionization of organic
      compounds. We provide a thorough validation of PORCO and demonstrate its
      capacity to detect ecologically driven variation in leaf emission rates
      and thus accelerate a nascent field of science: the ecology and
      ecophysiology of plant volatiles."

    title: Persistence of SARS CoV-2 S1 Protein in CD16+ Monocytes in Post-Acute
      Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) Up to 15 Months Post-Infection
    category: immunology
    abstract: The recent COVID-19 pandemic is a treatment challenge in the acute
      infection stage but the recognition of chronic COVID-19 symptoms termed
      post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) may affect up to 30% of
      all infected individuals. The underlying mechanism and source of this
      distinct immunologic condition three months or more after initial
      infection remains elusive. Here, we investigated the presence of
      SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein in 46 individuals. We analyzed T-cell, B-cell, and
      monocytic subsets in both severe COVID-19 patients and in patients with
      post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The levels of both intermediate
      (CD14+, CD16+) and non-classical monocyte (CD14Lo, CD16+) were
      significantly elevated in PASC patients up to 15 months post-acute
      infection compared to healthy controls (P=0.002 and P=0.01, respectively).
      A statistically significant number of non-classical monocytes contained
      SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein in both severe (P=0.004) and PASC patients (P=0.02)
      out to 15 months post-infection. Non-classical monocytes were sorted from
      PASC patients using flow cytometric sorting and the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein
      was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Cells from 4 out of 11 severe COVID-19
      patients and 1 out of 26 PASC patients contained ddPCR+ peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells, however, only fragmented SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in
      PASC patients. No full length sequences were identified, and no sequences
      that could account for the observed S1 protein were identified in any
      patient. Non-classical monocytes are capable of causing inflammation
      throughout the body in response to fractalkine/CX3CL1 and RANTES/CCR5.

      (My peer review no longer appears because it was made on the first version
      of the article, and it unfortunately did not receive a response before the
      manuscript was updated. I am thus reposting it here on the second version,
      hoping for a response. The review is identical to the first one, apart
      from the comment on the new sequencing data.)


      With this study, Patterson et al. present a potentially very significant finding: that SARS-CoV-2 antigen persists in non-classical monocytes from Long COVID patients up to 15 months after the initial infection. The data supporting this finding are of moderate to low strength, as presented, primarily due to a wide range of major and minor presentation issues that are listed below. Most of these can be addressed easily, though it is unclear if some additional controls may be required. Finally, some orthogonal approaches are suggested that could be potentially very valuable in terms of increasing confidence in the findings (namely microscopy and immunoblotting), though these are not essential for the interpretation of the results as shown.



      The authors are to be commended for tackling Long COVID head-on and getting right to the heart of the matter in terms of finding the pathological cause of this disease. That said, unfortunately, this manuscript requires considerable revision in order to be interpretable and allow others to reproduce the findings (which will be of critical importance, given their potential significance).





      Major issues:



      - Table 1 and the accompanying text seems to indicate that PBMCs were tested for the presence of viral RNA by ddPCR. However, in the Material/Methods section, it is stated that nucleic acids were extracted from plasma, not from PBMCs. Please clarify this point as it is of critical relevance. Indeed, both plasma and PBMCs should have been individually tested in order to determine whether viral RNA was solely intracellular.



      - It is very unclear what Figure 2 is presenting. Presumably each row represents a different subject, but it is not denoted which subject belongs to which group, making intepretation very difficult. I presume this was an ommission.



      - Supplementary Table 1 was not provided, making it very difficult to evaluate the flow cytometry data. Even if that table were present, the methods provided for flow cytometry are very sparse. What steps were undertaken to establish the specificity of the Spike antibody? Was the Spike staining done after fixation and permeabilization? Was PE conjugation of this antibody done in-house, and if so, using which kit, and how was it verified that the conjugation and quenching were successful and that staining was specific within the context of the entire antibody panel? Were FMO controls done in the context of this new panel that includes the S1 antibody? Was Fc block included? etc.



      - The newly-added sequencing data are difficult to interpret. It seems that the authors interpret the poor sequence coverage as indicative of non-replicating virus and in line with high Ct values, yet they do not seem to comment on the fact that there is nevertheless some seemingly full-length viral genome present in these cells! This is a potentially very important finding and its source will need to be investigated. Additionally, the sequencing results are inconsistent with the PBMC RT-PCR results, where only LH5 was positive, yet LH1-5 all had similar sequence coverage. The names of the samples in Table 2 do not correspond to any other name in this manuscript, clearly they were not renamed as they should have been. In fact, some of these sample names look curiously like name initials, which is a potential study subject data privacy issue. Finally, it does not seem that any healthy controls or previous COVID/non-LH subjects were tested in the same manner, which would be very valuable information.




      - In general, the Figure Legends are very sparse and should be much more descriptive.





      Minor/moderate issues:



      - Table 1 shows that one of the study subjects was asymptomatic. Where is this subject grouped in the subsequent analysis? ALso, "NS" is not defined, presumably it means "nasopharyngeal swab"?



      - In Figure 2, left column, the CD14/CD16 gates shown were not applied equally from sample to sample. Furthermore, in the middle column it looks like S1+ non-classical cells tend to have a low-SSC profile, while S1- cells have a high-SSC profile that clusters together with intermediate cells. This suggests that the intermediate/non-classical discriminating gates may not have been set appropriately. 



      - The quantification shown in the middle column of Figure 2 is labeled "CD16+CD14+COVIDS1+", however no "CD16+CD14+" subset is defined. Presumably the authors refer to the aggregate of the "CD14++CD16+" intermediate and "CD14loCD16+" non-classical subsets. This should be clearly stated as it makes interpretation of the data shown very difficult. Additionally, the quantification is based on the aggregate population, whereas based on the color coding, one would expect individual quantification for each subset. Given the relatively very minor contribution of the intermediate subset to the observed Spike S1 signal, it is unclear why this was included at all in this plot - why not just show the non-classical subset and base the quantification solely based on that, or alternatively, show quantification of each subset rather than their aggregate?



      - The labeling in Figure 3 could be better, the angled X axis labels are very difficult to follow. Maybe just indicate the monocyte subset as a title above each plot, and/or label each plot as a subfigure?



      - No information is provided on the statistical analyses done.



      - I did not look into all the cited work, but in one case (ref. no. 19) was puzzled to see that a review article was cited in which the relevant information was in turn derived from a single primary research article. Surely it makes more sense to just cite that primary research paper rather than the review?





      General comments:



      - Why was S1 the only SARS-CoV-2 antigen stained for? One would expect that you would have quickly tried to look for other viral antigens, particularly Nucleocapsid, in order to begin to understand whether there might be virus particles present, especially since you found viral RNA in some samples. Additionally, some microscopy data on sorted non-classical monocytes would have been very valuable to validate what you see by flow cytometry, also because one could then evaluate whether the Spike signal in these cells looks like the expected pattern for protein being actively synthesized by the cell and present on the cell surface, or whether it is captured antigen from some site of viral persistence and is sequestered in some intracellular compartment. Finally, a Western blot for Spike (and other viral antigens) in flow-sorted monocytes would be of immense value to further validate the presence of this antigen and observe the state of the protein - indeed, it is rather odd that you seemingly went for LCMS before trying either microscopy or a Western blot!



      - The potential connections with the CX3CL1 pathway mentioned in Discussion are very interesting. Unfortunately, the authors have not demonstrated any elevation of CX3CL1 associated with severe acute COVID or long COVID disease, nor the presence of CX3CR1 on the particular cells of interest. If such data exist, please present them, otherwise this Discussion is rather speculative and much more work will be required to frame it in the appropriate context for a primary research paper. Alternatively, this discussion might be better suited for a separate Review article.



      - Much of the published work on Long COVID and other post-COVID conditions such as MIS-C is omitted here, and should be cited and discussed as appropriate.

    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: "ACTIVATE-2: A DOUBLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF BCG VACCINATION AGAINST
      COVID19 IN INDIVIDUALS AT RISK"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: BCG vaccination induces heterologous protection against respiratory
      tract infections, and in children improves survival independently of
      tuberculosis prevention. The phase III ACTIVATE-2 study assessed whether
      BCG could also protect against COVID19 in the elderly. In this
      double-blind, randomized trial, elderly Greek patients were randomized
      (1:1) to receive either BCG revaccination or placebo at hospital
      discharge, followed by 6 months observation for incidence of COVID19
      infection. BCG revaccination resulted in 68% risk reduction for total
      COVID19 clinical and microbiological diagnoses (OR 0.32, 95% CI
      0.13-0.79). Five patients in the placebo group and one in the
      BCG-vaccinated group had severe COVID19 that necessitated hospitalization.
      3 months after BCG vaccination 1.3% of placebo and 4.7% of BCG-vaccinated
      volunteers had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These data argue that BCG
      revaccination is safe and protects the elderly against COVID19. BCG
      revaccination may represent a viable preventive measure against COVID19.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    title: "Your head is there to move you around: Goal-driven models of the primate
      dorsal pathway"
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: "Neurons in the dorsal visual pathway of the mammalian brain are
      selective for motion stimuli, with the complexity of stimulus
      representations increasing along the hierarchy. This progression is
      similar to that of the ventral visual pathway, which is well characterized
      by artificial neural networks (ANNs) optimized for object recognition. In
      contrast, there are no image-computable models of the dorsal stream with
      comparable explanatory power. We hypothesized that the properties of
      dorsal stream neurons could be explained by a simple learning objective:
      the need for an organism to orient itself during self-motion. To test this
      hypothesis, we trained a 3D ResNet in a self-supervised manner to predict
      an agent's self-motion parameters from visual stimuli in a simulated
      environment. We found that the responses in this network accounted well
      for the selectivity of neurons in a large database of single-neuron
      recordings from the dorsal visual stream of non-human primates. In
      contrast, ANNs trained for action recognition or with a contrastive
      objective could not explain responses in the dorsal stream, despite also
      being trained on naturalistic videos with moving objects. These results
      demonstrate that an ecologically relevant, self-supervised cost function
      can account for dorsal stream properties in the primate brain."

      There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2
      infection. The shortest path to clinical use is repurposing of drugs that
      have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a
      library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43,
      a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common-cold and is a relative of
      SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further evaluated the
      top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as
      other pathogenic RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited
      SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549 epithelial cell line),
      with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the
      mechanism of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally
      developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor for cancer treatment, strongly
      inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray
      crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site
      of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its enzymatic activity. Mastinib also
      inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked
      picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has
      broad anti-viral activity against two distinct beta-coronaviruses and
      multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong candidate
      for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    title: Genome Diversity in Ukraine
    category: genomics
    abstract: >-
      The main goal of this collaborative effort is to provide genome wide data
      for the previously underrepresented population in Eastern Europe, and to
      provide cross-validation of the data from genome sequences and genotypes
      of the same individuals acquired by different technologies. We collected
      97 genome-grade DNA samples from consented individuals representing major
      regions of Ukraine that were consented for the public data release.
      DNBSEQ-G50 sequences, and genotypes by an Illumina GWAS chip were
      cross-validated on multiple samples, and additionally referenced to one
      sample that has been resequenced by Illumina NovaSeq6000 S4 at high
      coverage. The genome data has been searched for genomic variation
      represented in this population, and a number of variants have been
      reported: large structural variants, indels, CNVs, SNPs and
      microsatellites. This study provides the largest to-date survey of genetic
      variation in Ukraine, creating a public reference resource aiming to
      provide data for historic and medical research in a large understudied
      population. While most of the common variation is shared with other
      European populations, this survey of population variation contributes a
      number of novel SNPs and structural variants that have not been reported
      in the gnomAD/1KG databases representing global distribution of genomic
      variation. This data will contribute a wealth of new information bringing
      forth different risk and/or protective alleles. The newly discovered low
      frequency and local variants can be added to the current genotyping arrays
      for genome wide association studies, clinical trials, and in genome
      assessment of proliferating cancer cells.

    title: Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.617.2 variant
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: The B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant has contributed to the
      surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe,
      including a notable increase in cases in the UK. We estimate the
      effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines against this
      variant. Methods: A test negative case control design was used to estimate
      the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both
      variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases
      identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all
      symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate
      the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain
      (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status. Results: Effectiveness was notably lower
      after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3)
      compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results
      for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 93.4%
      (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with
      B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI:
      54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2.
      Sequenced cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had a higher
      odds of infection with B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40;
      95%CI: 1.13-1.75). Conclusions: After 2 doses of either vaccine there were
      only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2
      variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked
      with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with two doses
      among vulnerable groups."

    title: Accurate Prediction of Breast Cancer Survival through Coherent Voting
      Networks with Gene Expression Profiling
    category: oncology
    abstract: We describe a novel machine learning methodology which we call
      Coherent Voting Network (CVN) and we demonstrate its usefulness by
      building a 5-years prognostic predictor for post-surgery breast cancer
      patients based on CVNs. Coherent Voting Network (CVN) is a supervised
      learning paradigm designed explicitly to uncover non-linear, combinatorial
      patterns in complex data, within a statistical robust framework. Breast
      Cancer patients after surgery may receive several types of post-surgery
      adjuvant therapeutic regimen (endocrine, radio- or chemo-therapy, and
      combinations thereof) aiming at reducing relapse and the formation of
      metastases, and thus favouring log term survival. We wish to predict the
      outcome of adjuvant therapy using just small molecular fingerprints (mRNA)
      of the patients transcriptome. Our aim is to have simultaneously high
      scores for PPV (positive predictive value) and NPV (negative predictive
      value) as these are important indices for the final clinical applications
      of the predictor. A Training-validate-test protocol is applied onto CVN
      built on patient data from the Metabric Consortium (about 2000 patients).
      For the testing pool of 82 lymph node positive patients we obtain PPV 0.77
      and NPV 0.78 (Odds Ratio 11.50); for the pool of 61 lymph node negative
      patients we obtain PPV 0.68 and NPV 0.88 (Odds Ratio 16.07). Improved
      results are obtained on some specific sub-types of BC. For the testing
      pool of 16 TNBC patients we obtain PPV 1.0 and NPV 0.83 (Odds Ratio
      45.00). For the testing pool of 18 HER2+ patients we obtain PPV 0.91 and
      NPV 1.0 (Odds Ratio 40.00). For the testing pool of 41 Luminal B patients
      we obtain PPV 0.75 and NPV 0.95 (Odds Ratio 60.00). Effectiveness of the
      selected fingerprints is confirmed also on several independent data sets
      (for a total of 601 patients) from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Rapid displacement of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 by B.1.617.2 and P.1 in
      the United States
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern B.1.617.2 displaced B.1.1.7 as the
      dominant variant in England and other countries. This study aimed to
      determine whether B.1.617.2 was also displacing B.1.1.7 in the United
      States. We analyzed PCR testing results and viral sequencing results of
      samples collected across the United States, and showed that B.1.1.7 was
      rapidly being displaced and is no longer responsible for the majority of
      new cases. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases that are B.1.1.7
      dropped from 67% in May 2021 to 33.4% in just 5 weeks. Our analysis showed
      rapid growth of variants B.1.617.2 and P.1 as the primary drivers for this
      displacement. Currently, the growth rate of B.1.617.2 was higher than P.1
      in the US (0.66 vs. 0.34), which is consistent with reports from other
      countries.

    title: "Efficacy of Proxalutamide in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A
      Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Design Clinical
      Trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is mediated by the androgen-promoted protease,
      transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Previously, we have shown that
      treatment with proxalutamide, a non-steroidal androgen receptor
      antagonist, accelerates viral clearance and clinical remission in
      outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to placebo.
      The effects in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unknown. Methods: Men
      and women hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation were
      randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 300 mg of proxalutamide per day or
      placebo for 14 days. The study was conducted at eight sites in the state
      of Amazonas, Brazil. The primary outcome measure was the clinical status
      (8-point ordinal scale) at 14-days post-randomization. The primary
      efficacy endpoint was the 14-day recovery ratio (alive hospital discharge
      [scores 1, 2]). Findings: A total of 645 patients were randomized (317
      received proxalutamide, 328 placebo) and underwent intention-to-treat
      analysis. The 14-day median ordinal scale score in the proxalutamide group
      was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]=1-2) versus 7 (IQR=2-8) for placebo,
      P<0.001. The 14-day recovery rate was 81.4% for proxalutamide and 35.7%
      for placebo (recovery ratio, 2.28; 95% CI 1.95-2.66 [P<0.001]). The 28-day
      all-cause mortality rate was 11.0% for proxalutamide versus 49.4% for
      placebo (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI 0.11-0.24). The median
      post-randomization time to recovery was 5 days (IQR=3-8) for proxalutamide
      versus 10 days (IQR=6-15) for placebo. Interpretation: Hospitalized
      COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation receiving
      proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with
      placebo. All-cause mortality was reduced by 77.7% over 28 days.

      In their discussion, the authors attribute the imbalance between study
      arms within hospital sites in Table S1 to the fact that randomization was
      not stratified by study site and to batch delivery of drugs to remote
      sites. However, if the trial was truly randomized as described in the
      Supplementary Appendix, it is hard to understand how the extreme imbalance
      in the distribution of arms in each site could have happened by chance
      alone.

      When one considers the distribution of arms in the 3 centers located in Manaus, where patients are described to have been randomized independently, there is a total of 97 patients in the active group vs. 298 in the placebo group. Using the chisq.test function in R, the p value for obtaining this distribution if patients had an equal chance of being randomized to either group is 4.8e-24 (amounting to a chance of roughly 1 in 200 sextillion).

      For the remote sites, one cannot estimate this chance exactly, as the authors report that randomization was performed for batches of 5-50 patients. Nevertheless, the distribution is even more unbalanced (220 patients in the active group vs. 30 patients in the placebo group), and also seems unlikely to have occurred by chance (and in the opposite direction as that of Manaus, thus balancing the distribution in the whole trial almost exactly).

      Although this imbalance would not explain the difference in the main outcomes between groups by itself, as the stratified analyses in Tables S3 and S4 show effects favoring the active treatment at all sites, it does call into question whether randomization was really carried out as described. Can the authors please clarify on what happened?

    title: "Countering reproducibility issues in mathematical models with software
      engineering techniques: A case study using a one-dimensional mathematical
      model of the atrioventricular node"
    category: systems-biology
    abstract: One should assume that in silico experiments in systems biology are
      less susceptible to reproducibility issues than their wet-lab
      counterparts, because they are free from natural biological variations and
      their environment can be fully controlled. However, recent studies show
      that only half of the published mathematical models of biological systems
      can be reproduced without substantial effort. In this article we examine
      the potential causes for failed or cumbersome reproductions in a case
      study of a one-dimensional mathematical model of the atrioventricular
      node, which took us four months to reproduce. The model demonstrates that
      even otherwise rigorous studies can be hard to reproduce due to missing
      information, errors in equations and parameters, a lack in available data
      files, non-executable code, missing or incomplete experiment protocols,
      and missing rationales behind equations. Many of these issues seem similar
      to problems that have been solved in software engineering using techniques
      such as unit testing, regression tests, continuous integration, version
      control, archival services, and a thorough modular design with extensive
      documentation. Applying these techniques, we reimplement the examined
      model using the modeling language Modelica. The resulting workflow is
      independent of the model and can be translated to SBML, CellML, and other
      languages. It guarantees methods reproducibility by executing automated
      tests in a virtual machine on a server that is physically separated from
      the development environment. Additionally, it facilitates results
      reproducibility, because the model is more understandable and because the
      complete model code, experiment protocols, and simulation data are
      published and can be accessed in the exact version that was used in this
      article. We found the additional design and documentation effort well
      justified, even just considering the immediate benefits during development
      such as easier and faster debugging, increased understandability of
      equations, and a reduced requirement for looking up details from the
      literature.

      You are correct that MBSE in general have usability problems. We wrote a
      paper about it (Shaked and Reich, 2021), demonstrating that
      domain-specific modeling - a particular way of MBSE - is much more
      approachable and the paper I pointed to in my previous message (Shaked and
      reich, 2020), is exactly such domain-specific modeling. It is much easier
      than general purpose and could be tailored to fit particular purposed.

    abstract: Repositioning of clinical approved drugs could represent the fastest
      way to identify therapeutic options during public health emergencies, the
      majority of drugs explored for repurposing as antivirals for 2019
      coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have failed to demonstrate clinical
      benefit. Without specific antivirals, the severe acute respiratory
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major
      global mortality. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine
      (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. CQ/HCQ entered the Solidarity and RECOVERY
      clinical trials against COVID-19 and showed lack of efficacy. Importantly,
      mefloquine is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ and HCQ and has been
      previously repurposed for other respiratory diseases. Unlike the
      4-aminoquinolines that accumulate in the high pH of intracellular
      lysosomes of the lung, the high respiratory tract penetration of
      mefloquine is driven by its high lipophilicity. While CQ and HCQ exhibit
      activity in Vero E6 cells, their activity is obviated in
      TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as Calu-3 cells, which more accurately
      recapitulate in vivo entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, here we
      report the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mefloquine in Calu-3 type II
      pneumocytes and primary human monocytes. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2
      replication, including the gamma variant, in Calu-3 cells with low
      cytotoxicity and EC50 and EC90 values of 1.2 and 5.3 uM, respectively. In
      addition, mefloquine reduced up to 68% the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in
      infected monocytes, reducing viral-induced inflammation. Mefloquine
      blocked early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and was less prone
      than CQ to induce drug-associated viral mutations and synergized with RNA
      polymerase inhibitor. The pharmacological parameters of mefloquine are
      consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma
      predicted coefficient points that this drug may accumulate in the lungs.
      These data indicate that mefloquine could represent an orally available
      clinically approved drug option against COVID-19 and should not be
      neglected on the basis of the failure of CQ and HCQ.

    title: Early functional connectivity in the developing sensorimotor network that
      is independent of sensory experience
    category: neuroscience
    abstract: Neonatal sensory experience shapes development of neural pathways
      carrying sensory information to the cortex. These pathways link to wider
      functional networks that coordinate activity of separate cortical regions,
      but it remains unknown when these broader networks emerge or how their
      maturation is influenced by sensory experience. By imaging activity across
      the cortex in neonatal mice, we have found unexpectedly early emergence of
      coordinated activity within a sensorimotor network that includes
      whisker-related somatosensory cortex and motor cortex. This network is
      spontaneously active but is not engaged by sensory stimulation, even
      though whisker deflection reliably drives cortical activity within barrel
      cortex. Acute silencing of the sensory periphery ablated spontaneous
      activity that was restricted to barrel cortex but spared this early
      sensorimotor network coactivity, suggesting that it is driven from
      elsewhere. Furthermore, perturbing sensory experience by whisker trimming
      did not impact emergence or early maturation of spontaneous activity in
      the sensorimotor network. As such, functional sensorimotor cortical
      networks develop early and, in contrast to development of ascending
      sensory pathways, their initial maturation is independent of sensory
      experience.

    title: Measuring biodiversity from DNA in the air
    category: ecology
    abstract: Impacts of the biodiversity crisis far exceed our ability to monitor
      changes in terrestrial ecosystems. Environmental DNA has revolutionized
      aquatic biomonitoring, permitting remote population and diversity
      assessments. Here we demonstrate that DNA from terrestrial animals can now
      be collected from the air under natural conditions, a ground-breaking
      advance for terrestrial biomonitoring. Using air samples from a zoological
      park, where species are spatially confined and unique compared to native
      fauna, we show that DNA in air can be used to identify the captive species
      and their potential interactions with local taxa. Air samples contained
      DNA from 25 species of mammal and bird including 17 known (and distinct)
      terrestrial zoo species. We also identified food items from air sampled in
      enclosures and detected four taxa native to the local area, including the
      Eurasian hedgehog, endangered in the UK, and the muntjac deer, a locally
      established invasive species. Our data provide evidence that airDNA is
      concentrated around recently inhabited areas (e.g., indoor enclosures) but
      that there is dispersal away from the source suggesting an ecology to
      airDNA movement which highlights the potential for airDNA sampling at
      distance. Our data clearly demonstrate the profound potential of air as a
      source of DNA for global terrestrial biomonitoring and ecological
      analysis.

      Dear Authors,

      I have some suggestions regarding your preprint.

      Although the investigation of eDNA from air is an understudied field let me make you aware of some studies which were mainly focused on microbial an fungal bioaerosols (10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144092, 10.1073/pnas.0811003106, 10.1093/femsec/fiy031) and collection methods (e.g. 10.1021/acs.est.7b01480, 10.1371/journal.pone.0141158, 10.1128/AEM.01589-18). Maybe you want to include some of this literature in your manuscript.

      In addition it would be great if you could add the primer sequence of Mam1 and Mam2 to the manuscript. Regarding figure 2, I guess it could help if you included boxplots in 2a and maybe a logarithmic scale for Fig.2b or you may think to exclude the two outliers form the visualization.

      All the best

      Isabella

    title: A Genetic Screen for Suppressors of Cryptic 5' Splicing in C. elegans
      Reveals Roles for KIN17 and PRCC in Maintaining Both 5' and 3' Splice Site
      Identity
    category: molecular-biology
    abstract: Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step of eukaryotic gene expression
      carried out by a series of dynamic macromolecular protein/RNA complexes,
      known collectively and individually as the spliceosome. This series of
      spliceosomal complexes define, assemble on, and catalyze the removal of
      introns. Molecular model snapshots of intermediates in the process have
      been created from cryo-EM data, however, many aspects of the dynamic
      changes that occur in the spliceosome are not fully understood.
      Caenorhabditis elegans follow the GU-AG rule of splicing, with almost all
      introns beginning with 5' GU and ending with 3' AG. These splice sites are
      identified early in the splicing cycle, but as the cycle progresses and
      ''custody'' of the pre-mRNA splice sites is passed from factor to factor
      as the catalytic site is built, the mechanism by which splice site
      identity is maintained or re-established through these dynamic changes is
      unclear. We performed a genetic screen in C. elegans for factors that are
      capable of changing 5' splice site choice. We report that KIN17 and PRCC
      are involved in splice site choice, the first functional splicing role
      proposed for either of these proteins. Previously identified suppressors
      of cryptic 5' splicing promote distal cryptic GU splice sites, however,
      mutations in KIN17 and PRCC instead promote usage of an unusual proximal
      5' splice site which defines an intron beginning with UU, separated by 1nt
      from a GU donor. We performed high-throughput mRNA sequencing analysis and
      found that mutations in PRCC but not KIN17 changed 5' splice sites
      genome-wide, promoting usage of nearby non-consensus sites. We further
      found that mutations in KIN17 and PRCC changed dozens of 3' splice sites,
      promoting non-consensus sites upstream of canonical splice sites. Our work
      has uncovered both fine and coarse mechanisms by which the spliceosome
      maintains splice site identity during the complex assembly process.

    title: ACCLIMATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO THE ENVIRONMENT 1 regulates Photosystem
      II Supercomplex dynamics in response to light in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
    category: plant-biology
    abstract: Photosynthetic organisms require acclimation mechanisms to regulate
      photosynthesis in response to light conditions. Here, two mutant alleles
      of ACCLIMATION OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS TO THE ENVIRONMENT 1 (ape1) have been
      characterized in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The ape1 mutants are
      photosensitive and show PSII photoinhibition during high light acclimation
      or under high light stress. The ape1 mutants retain more PSII
      super-complexes and have changes to thylakoid stacking relative to control
      strains during photosynthetic growth at different light intensities. The
      APE1 protein is found in all oxygenic phototrophs and encodes a 25 kDa
      thylakoid protein that interacts with the Photosystem II core complex as
      monomers, dimers and supercomplexes. We propose a model where APE1 bound
      to PSII supercomplexes releases core complexes and promotes PSII
      heterogeneity influencing the stacking of Chlamydomonas thylakoids. APE1
      is a regulator in light acclimation and its function is to reduce
      over-excitation of PSII centres and avoid PSII photoinhibition to increase
      the resilience of photosynthesis to high light.

      The manuscript by Chazaux et al. presents the characterisation of
      <i>ape1</i> mutant alleles of Chlamydomonas and shows that they do not
      acclimate as well to increases in light intensity as does the wild type,
      consistent with the Arabidopsis <i>ape1</i> mutant described in 2003
      (Walters et al.). The authors have clearly shown that APE1 is a thylakoid
      membrane protein required for the proper function of PSII at high light
      intensities. The absence of APE1 leads to changes in thylakoid
      architecture and an altered composition of photosynthetic complexes (20%
      less D1/D2 and 20% more LHCII in ape1). In this new submission, they have
      unequivocally demonstrated that APE1 directly interacts with PSII
      (co-migration of APE1 with the monomer and dimer of PSII which is altered
      in deltaPSII but not in deltaPSI as well as cross-linking with PSII).
      Furthermore, they have shown that in the absence of APE1, PSII
      supercomplexes (sc) accumulate (BN-2D and in vivo measurements of antenna
      size). This accumulation of PSII sc leads to photoinhibition and the
      authors propose that the role of APE1 is to modulate the formation of
      supercomplexes for optimal photosynthesis.


      I largely agree with these conclusions and think that this body of work moves the field forward. I have several comments however that should be addressed (see below). My main issue lies in the interpretation of Figure 7A and B (photoinhibition experiment) and lines 314-318. My previous comment on that point still stands: if D1 damage would be increased in <i>ape1</i>, we should expect a lower amount of D1 upon inhibition of repair. However according to Fig7B, this is not the case (<i>ape1</i> has apparently the same level of D1 as in wt). The <i>mph1</i> mutant described by Liu and Last 2015 Plant Journal 82:731–743, is proposed to have more PSII damage which translates as less D1 accumulation upon inhibition of repair (coincidentally also in Figure 7B!) Granted this is in Arabidopsis and the timepoint for D1 is 2h HL, I would still recommend repeating that experiment e.g. a 2h HL+inh checking D1 accumulation. As is, what I take away from Fig7B is that the rate of repair is slower in ape1. If I understand correctly, the authors imply that because of the large antenna size, D1 is more prone to photodamage but given this other interpretation (slower D1 repair), how about the idea that repair is slower due to D1 being more trapped in PSII dimer and sc? You discuss this idea in paragraph from line 519.


      This interpretation better fits the conservation of APE1 in cyanobacteria which do not possess PSII sc and agrees with the possible constitutive function in maintenance of PSII state described line 516. The title of the article should then be changed accordingly.


      Major comments


      Line 71 - I understand the decision from the authors to cite reviews and state that “many” proteins are involved in PSII biogenesis, maintenance and repair. I would however recommend citing Liu and Last 2019 Frontiers in Plant Science 10:975 and either introduce or discuss more what factors are known to modulate PSII sc (e.g. from this review MET1; in <i>met1</i> mutant less PSII SC, accelerated D1 degradation; as stated above should we expect <i>ape1</i>, more PSII SC, slower D1 degradation?)

      Line 114, line 256 - RC47 should be defined as reaction center 47 (see Komenda J 2006 J Biol Chem 281: 1145–1151), it can be both an assembly or repair intermediate.

      Line 129 - “Atape1” should be written as “The Arabidopsis <i>ape1</i> mutant” for clarity.

      Line 229 – “and is not strictly required for their assembly”, I do not agree with that statement, chaperone required for assembly can accumulate to wild type level in absence of the main subunit of a given complex.

      Line 319 to 325 – Description of partial complementation (lower chla/b in HL and intermediate GPX5 accumulation) and possible explanation (since APE1 protein accumulates to wild type level) should be provided.

      Line 341 – for this paragraph, it would help the non-initiated to add more introduction on alpha and beta centres and what is meant exactly by “PSII heterogeneity”.

      Line 573 – The method for generating the mutant library that led to isolation of <i>ape1-1</i> is missing

      Line 676 -  Provide amino acid number where the sequence used for recombinant proteins starts

      Fig1D,E – The data is the same as in the previous submitted version, <i>ape1-1</i> should say <i>drbcL ape1-1</i> in Fig1D,F and 1E control is cc-4533.

      Figure 2B – orientation of protein? please indicate stroma and lumen compartment

      Fig2C – comment on reason for signal to be lower in isolated thylakoid compared to total cell extracts, usually the opposite occurs, unless APE1 is dual-targeted?

      Fig4B – comment on more PSI(2) band in <i>ape1</i> mutant

      Fig5 – comment on APE1 oligomers. I agree that cross-linking with PSII demonstrates that APE1 is not a free protein but upon solubilization different subcomplexes are resolved, especially in the deltaPSI and deltaPSII mutants.

      Fig7C – comment on nature of the band right below E and above F enriched in the complemented line.


      Minor comments

      Line 147 and other instances – Figures are called twice

      Line 184 – should read “violaceus”

      Line 286 – change decorated to probed

      Line 401 – should read “photoinhibition”

      Fig6A – annotate nature of B5 and 8 to help reader

      Fig9 – is this in MIN? how many days? Light intensity?

    title: The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Familial Hypercholesterolemia
      Variant Curation Expert Panel consensus guidelines for LDLR variant
      classification
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: "Purpose: In 2015, the American College of Medical Genetics and
      Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP)
      published consensus standardized guidelines for variant classification in
      Mendelian disorders. To increase accuracy and consistency, the Clinical
      Genome Resource (ClinGen) Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) Variant
      Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) was tasked with optimizing the existing
      ACMG/AMP framework for disease-specific classification in FH. Here, we
      provide consensus recommendations for the most common FH-causing gene,
      LDLR, where >2,300 unique FH-associated variants have been identified.
      Methods: The multidisciplinary FH VCEP met in person and through frequent
      emails and conference calls to develop LDLR-specific modifications of
      ACMG/AMP guidelines. Through iteration, pilot testing, debate and
      commentary, consensus among experts was reached. Results: The consensus
      LDLR variant modifications to existing ACMG/AMP guidelines include: 1)
      alteration of population frequency thresholds; 2) delineation of
      loss-of-function variant types; 3) functional study criteria
      specifications; 4) co-segregation criteria specifications; and 5) specific
      use and thresholds for in silico prediction tools, among others.
      Conclusion: Establishment of these guidelines as the new standard in the
      clinical laboratory setting will result in a more evidence-based,
      harmonized method for LDLR variant classification worldwide, thereby
      improving the care of FH patients."

    title: "GestaltMatcher: Overcoming the limits of rare disease matching using
      facial phenotypic descriptors"
    category: genetic-and-genomic-medicine
    abstract: A large fraction of monogenic disorders causes craniofacial
      abnormalities with characteristic facial morphology. These disorders can
      be diagnosed more efficiently with the support of computer-aided
      next-generation phenotyping tools, such as DeepGestalt. These tools have
      learned to associate facial phenotypes with the underlying syndrome
      through training on thousands of patient photographs. However, this
      "supervised" approach means that diagnoses are only possible if the
      disorder was part of the training set. To improve recognition of
      ultra-rare disorders, we created GestaltMatcher, which uses a deep
      convolutional neural network based on the DeepGestalt framework. We used
      photographs of 17,560 patients with 1,115 rare disorders to define a
      "Clinical Face Phenotype Space". Distance between cases in the phenotype
      space defines syndromic similarity, allowing test patients to be matched
      to a molecular diagnosis even when the disorder was not included in the
      training set. Similarities among patients with previously unknown disease
      genes can also be detected. Therefore, in concert with mutation data,
      GestaltMatcher could accelerate the clinical diagnosis of patients with
      ultra-rare disorders and facial dysmorphism, as well as enable the
      delineation of novel phenotypes.

    title: Viral Load of SARS-CoV-2 in Respiratory Aerosols Emitted by COVID-19
      Patients while Breathing, Talking, and Singing
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Multiple SARS-CoV-2 superspreading events suggest that
      aerosols play an important role in driving the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
      the detailed roles of coarse (>5m) and fine ([&le;]5m) respiratory
      aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing are not
      well-understood. Methods: Using a G-II exhaled breath collector, we
      measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by
      COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking,
      and 15 minutes of singing. Results: Among the 22 study participants, 13
      (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols,
      including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral
      loads ranged from 63 - 5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity.
      Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA, and
      loads differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing. The
      largest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was emitted by singing (53%),
      followed by talking (41%) and breathing (6%). Overall, fine aerosols
      constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures
      were negative. Conclusions: Fine aerosols produced by talking and singing
      contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a
      significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to fine
      aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where
      airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur. Isolating viable
      SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and
      whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2
      variants is an important enquiry for future studies."

    raw_message: Fascinating, thanks. What I can’t square between studies like yours
      and the one on cynomolgus monkeys on the one hand, and the range of
      estimates of sizes of droplets in respiratory exhalations on the other (as
      recently reviewed by Lydia Bourouiba for example), is how the quantity of
      viral RNA apparently scales with the *number* of droplets rather than
      their volume. It implies that the concentration of viruses per droplet is
      hugely dependent on the size of the droplet and I can’t think of a
      mechanism to achieve this - are viruses massively self-repelling? (over
      micron-scale distances?) Are they highly surface active? I wonder if you
      have thought about this.

    abstract: Deep learning-based prediction of protein structure usually begins by
      constructing a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) containing homologues of
      the target protein. The most successful approaches combine large feature
      sets derived from MSAs, and considerable computational effort is spent
      deriving these input features. We present a method that greatly reduces
      the amount of preprocessing required for a target MSA, while producing
      main chain coordinates as a direct output of a deep neural network. The
      network makes use of just three recurrent networks and a stack of residual
      convolutional layers, making the predictor very fast to run, and easy to
      install and use. Our approach constructs a directly learned representation
      of the sequences in an MSA, starting from a one-hot encoding of the
      sequences. When supplemented with an approximate precision matrix, the
      learned representation can be used to produce structural models of
      comparable or greater accuracy as compared to our original DMPfold method,
      while requiring less than a second to produce a typical model. This level
      of accuracy and speed allows very large-scale 3-D modelling of proteins on
      minimal hardware, and we demonstrate that by producing models for over 1.3
      million uncharacterized regions of proteins extracted from the BFD
      sequence clusters. After constructing an initial set of approximate
      models, we select a confident subset of over 30,000 models for further
      refinement and analysis, revealing putative novel protein folds. We also
      provide updated models for over 5,000 Pfam families studied in the
      original DMPfold paper.

    title: Loss of a subunit of vacuolar ATPase identifies unexpected biological
      signatures of reduced organelle acidification in vivo
    category: molecular-biology
    abstract: The inability to maintain a strictly regulated endo(lyso)somal acidic
      pH through the proton-pumping action of the vacuolar-ATPases has been
      associated with various human diseases including heritable connective
      tissue disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Multiple studies
      have investigated the pleiotropic effects of reduced acidification in
      vitro, but the mechanisms elicited by impaired endo(lyso)somal
      acidification in vivo remain poorly understood. Here, we show that loss of
      atp6v1e1b in zebrafish leads to early mortality, associated with
      craniofacial dysmorphisms, vascular anomalies, cardiac dysfunction,
      hypotonia and epidermal structural defects, reminiscent of the phenotypic
      manifestations in cutis laxa patients carrying a defect in the ATP6V1E1
      gene. Mechanistically, we found that in vivo genetic depletion of
      atp6v1e1b leads to N-glycosylation defects and reduced maturation of
      endosomal and lysosomal vesicles, but retains the hypoxia-mediated
      response. In order to gain further insights into the processes affected by
      aberrant organelle acidification, we performed an untargeted analysis of
      the transcriptome and metabolome in early atp6v1e1b-deficient larvae. We
      report multiple affected pathways including but not limited to oxidative
      phosphorylation, sphingolipid and fatty acid metabolism with profound
      defects in mitochondrial respiration. Taken together, our results identify
      new complex biological effects of reduced organelle acidification in vivo,
      which likely contribute to the multisystemic manifestations observed in
      disorders caused by v-ATPase deficiency.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

    raw_message: Masks work. This is a statement of fact. I can make this statement
      because viruses must follow physical laws. So until you or anyone else can
      provide a body of evidence showing that viruses are not bound by physical
      laws you have no argument. We do however need to deal with that body of
      evidence how is it some studies reach a conclusion that’s opposed to
      reality? By having a fatal flaw. This study has it. The goal is to
      determine if masks are effective. So why are they studying if people are
      actually wearing them? Assuming that a mandate means higher mask usage is
      a bad assumption. Assuming no mandate lowers usage is another bad
      assumption. Assuming that areas with and without mandates are closed
      systems is a really bad assumption. Yet for this study and indeed the body
      of evidence you claim supports the masks don’t work conclusion to work as
      intended and be capable of answering the question all these things would
      need to be true. And as someone who has traveled through areas with and
      without mandates I can say none of those appear to be true. So how do
      masks work? This is important to understand many people assume that the
      goal is filtration but it’s not. Sure a cloth or paper mask can filter a
      lot of droplets and the particles with them but that’s not the primary
      mechanism here. How does a sail catch the wind? The air is perfectly
      capable of passing right through a cloth sail so how does that work? Air
      is a fluid which for our purposes means it takes the path of least
      resistance. If you take the carrier of a virus no mask and just normal
      breathing droplets containing viral particles will quickly spread out into
      the surrounding area where they will be inhaled by others thus infecting
      them as well. However if you have some sort of barrier in place like say a
      mask the air will quickly loose energy the droplets as well and they will
      fall quickly and for the most part harmlessly to the ground. Why mandates
      and not just choice? Well if you could not guess by the description the
      mechanic at play isn’t filtration. Yes a cloth or paper mask can capture
      some droplets but respiration has a vacuum element and if someone infected
      without a mask is spewing particles people around them are still going to
      suck those in. So the function of a mask isn’t to protect yourself it’s to
      protect other people. That wraps up this mini lecture any questions?

    title: Addressing anti-syncytin antibody levels, and fertility and breastfeeding
      concerns, following BNT162B2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccination
    category: obstetrics-and-gynecology
    abstract: "Objective: To determine whether antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2
      spike protein following BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) COVID-19 mRNA
      vaccination cross-react with human syncytin-1 protein, and if BNT162B2
      mRNA enters breast milk. Methods: In this observational cohort study of
      female front-line workers with no history of COVID-19 infection, we
      amplified BNT162B2 mRNA in plasma and breast milk and assayed
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies and anti-human syncytin-1 binding
      antibodies in plasma, at early (1-4 days) and late (4-7 weeks) time points
      following first-dose vaccination. Results: Fifteen consented participants
      (mean age 40.4 years, various ethnicities) who received at least one dose
      of BNT162B2, including five breast-feeding women and two women who were
      inadvertently vaccinated in early pregnancy, were recruited. BNT162B2
      mRNA, detected by amplifying part of the spike-encoding region, was
      detected in plasma 1-4 days following the first dose (n=13), but not 4-5
      weeks later (n=2), nor was the mRNA isolated from aqueous or lipid breast
      milk fractions collected 0-7 days post-vaccination (n=5). Vaccine
      recipients demonstrated strong SARS-CoV-2 neutralising activity by at
      least four weeks after the first dose (n=15), including the two pregnant
      women. None had placental anti-syncytin-1 binding antibodies at either
      time-point following vaccination. Conclusions: BNT162B2-vaccinated women
      did not transmit vaccine mRNA to breast milk, and did not produce a
      concurrent humoral response to syncytin-1, suggesting that
      cross-reactivity to syncytin-1 on the developing trophoblast, or other
      adverse effects in the breast-fed infant from vaccine mRNA ingestion, are
      unlikely."

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 cause significantly increased vaccine
      breakthrough COVID-19 cases in Houston, Texas
    category: pathology
    abstract: Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have repeatedly altered the course of
      the COVID-19 pandemic, and disease in individual patients. Delta variants
      (B.1.617.2, AY.2, and AY.3) are now the focus of international concern
      because they are causing widespread COVID-19 disease globally. Vaccine
      breakthrough cases caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants also are of considerable
      public health and medical concern worldwide. As part of a comprehensive
      project, we sequenced the genomes of 3,913 SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples
      acquired March 15, 2021 through July 3, 2021 in the Houston Methodist
      hospital system and studied vaccine breakthrough cases. During the study
      period Delta variants increased to cause 58% of all COVID-19 cases and
      spread throughout the metropolitan Houston area. In addition, Delta
      variants caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases
      (19.7% compared to 5.8% for all other variants). Importantly, only 6.5% of
      all COVID-19 cases occurred in fully immunized individuals, and relatively
      few of these patients required hospitalization. Our genomic and
      epidemiologic data emphasize that vaccines used in the United States are
      highly effective in decreasing severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalizations,
      and deaths.

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      Mask didn't work in 1918 because less than half wore mask,  however, those
      cities that did have mask. Mandates did fair better than those without. 


      Cloth mask are not 100% effective and air tight suit is.

      Animal models recapitulating the distinctive features of severe COVID-19
      are critical to enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.
      Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)
      under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the cause(s) and mechanisms of lethality in
      this mouse model remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal
      dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 14 days post-infection. Despite
      infection and moderate inflammation in the lungs, lethality was invariably
      associated with viral neuroinvasion and neuronal damage (including spinal
      motor neurons). Neuroinvasion occurred following virus transport through
      the olfactory neuroepithelium in a manner that was only partially
      dependent on hACE2. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 tropism was overall neither
      widespread among nor restricted to only ACE2-expressing cells. Although
      our work incites caution in the utility of the K18-hACE2 model to study
      global aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it underscores this model as a
      unique platform for exploring the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2
      neuropathogenesis.


      SUMMARYCOVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a betacoronavirus. Here, we show that in a widely used transgenic mouse model of COVID-19, lethality is invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and the ensuing neuronal disease, while lung inflammation remains moderate.

    raw_message: Actually he's very right, as someone who lives on the border of a
      state that required mask and a state that did not,  the laws made no
      difference.  Many workers did not enforce mask usage despite them being
      required to.  For this study to have validity it needs to measure how many
      people were following the guidelines.  Further a great number of
      businesses in the state that required mask refused to enforce the mask
      mandate,  the police in my metropolitan area also refused to enforce mask
      mandates.  These are all important things.  What this study measures is
      not the efficancy of mask, but how well mask mandates had on the impact of
      the spread,  this is two different things.

      profile, and the only ARTIVeda-related adverse events were transient mild
      rash and mild hypertension. Notably, ARTIVeda, when added to the SOC,
      accelerated the recovery of patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. While
      all patients were symptomatic at baseline (WHO score = 2-4), 31 of 39
      (79.5%) of patients treated with ARTIVeda plus SOC became asymptomatic
      (WHO score = 1) by the end of the 5-day therapy, including 10 of 10
      patients with severe dry cough 7 of 7 patients with severe fever. By
      comparison, 12 of 21 control patients (57.1%) treated with SOC alone
      became asymptomatic on day 5 (P=0.028, Fishers exact test). This clinical
      benefit was particularly evident when the treatment outcomes of
      hospitalized COVID-19 patients (WHO score = 4) treated with SOC alone
      versus SOC plus ARTIVeda were compared. The median time to becoming
      asymptomatic was only 5 days for the SOC plus ARTIVeda group (N=18) but 14
      days for the SOC alone group (N=10) (P=0.004, Log-rank test). These data
      provide clinical proof of concept that targeting the TGF-b pathway with
      ARTIVeda may contribute to a faster recovery of patients with
      mild-moderate COVID-19 when administered early in the course of their
      disease."

    title: Allosteric regulation in CRISPR/Cas1-Cas2 protospacer acquisition
      mediated by DNA in association with Cas2
    category: biophysics
    abstract: >-
      Cas1 and Cas2 are highly conserved proteins across CRISPR-Cas systems and
      play a significant role in protospacer acquisition. Here we study the
      protospacer (or ps) DNA binding, recognition, and response to cleavage on
      the protospacer-adjacent-motif complementary sequence or PAMc by
      Cas1-Cas2, implementing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. First, we
      noticed that two active sites of Cas1&1′ bind asymmetrically to two
      identical PAMc in the simulation. For psDNA containing only one PAMc to be
      recognized, it is then found that the non-PAMc association site remains
      destabilized until after the bound PAMc being cleaved. Thus, correlation
      appears to exist between the two active sites, which can be allosterically
      mediated by psDNA and Cas2&2′ in bridging. To substantiate such findings,
      we further simulated Cas1-Cas2 in complex with synthesized psDNA sequences
      psL and psH, which have been measured with low and high efficiency in
      acquisition, respectively. Notably, such inter-site correlation becomes
      largely enhanced for Cas1-Cas2 in complex with psH, and remains low with
      psL. Hence, our studies demonstrate that PAMc recognition and cleavage in
      one active site of Cas1-Cas2 allosterically regulates non-PAMc
      association/reaction in the other site, and such allosteric regulation is
      mediated by non-catalytic Cas2 and DNA protospacer in acquisition.

    title: A proteomics database for CNS proteins of the great pond snail Lymnaea
      stagnalis
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: Applications of key technologies in bioscientific and biomedical
      research, such as qRT-PCR or LC-MS based proteomics, are generating large
      biological data sets (omics data) which are useful for the identification
      and quantification of biomarkers involved in molecular mechanisms of any
      research area of interest. Genome, transcriptome and proteome databases
      are already available for a number of model organisms including
      vertebrates and invertebrates. However, there is insufficient information
      available for protein sequences of certain invertebrates, such as the
      great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a model organism that has been used
      highly successfully in elucidating evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of
      learning and memory, ageing and age-related as well as amyloid beta
      induced memory decline. Here, we present the design and benchmarking of a
      new proteomics database (LymSt-PDB) for the identification of proteins
      from the Central Nervous System (CNS) of Lymnaea stagnalis by LC-MS based
      proteomics.

      Dear my Lymnaea friends,

      Thank you for your wonderful job for the preparation of database of proteomics.

      We are now applying LC-MS to our Lymnaea studies and thus your database encourages to advance our studies.

      Please continue such useful work to not only Lymnaea researchers but also other molluscan researchers.

      Best,

      Etsu

    title: Antibody and T cell responses to Sinopharm/BBIBP-CorV in naive and
      previously infected individuals in Sri Lanka
    category: allergy-and-immunology
    abstract: "Background: As there are limited data of the immunogenicity of the
      Sinopharm/BBIBP-CorV in different populations, antibody responses against
      different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and T cell responses, we
      investigated the immunogenicity of the vaccine, in individuals in Sri
      Lanka. Methods: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were measured in 282
      individuals who were seronegative at baseline, and ACE2 receptor blocking
      antibodies, antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the wild
      type (WT), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, ex vivo and cultured IFN{gamma}
      ELISpot assays, intracellular cytokine secretion assays and B cell ELISpot
      assays were carried out in a sub cohort of the vaccinees at 4 weeks and at
      6 weeks (2 weeks after the second dose). Results: 95% of the vaccinees
      seroconverted, although the seroconversion rates were significantly lower
      (p<0.001) in individuals >60 years (93.3%) compared to those who were 20
      to 39 years (98.9%). 81.25% had ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies at 6
      weeks, and there was no difference in these antibody titres in vaccine
      sera compared to convalescent sera (p=0.44). Vaccinees had significantly
      less (p<0.0001) antibodies to the RBD of WT and B.1.1.7, although there
      was no difference in antibodies to the RBD of B.1.351 and B.1.617.2
      compared to convalescent sera. 27.7% of 46.4% of vaccinees had ex vivo
      IFN{gamma} and cultured ELISpot responses respectively, and IFN{gamma} and
      CD107a responses were detected by flow cytometry. Conclusions:
      Sinopharm/BBIBP-CorV appeared to induce high seroconversion rates and
      induce a similar level of antibody responses against ACE2 receptor,
      B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 as seen following natural infection."

      This study shows there is some immunity has built up in vaccinated
      individuals. But we still don't know whether this immunity can prevent the
      infection or the severity of disease if infected. 


      This study is not an assessment of the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death of vaccinated group against a non-vaccinated group, nor a comparison between different vaccines. We still don't know the efficacy of most vaccines against VOCs like delta. It's better to adhere to safety measures even if you are vaccinated, until we have better data to say otherwise.

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

    abstract: >-
      Pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and HIV hijack the host molecular
      machinery to establish infection and survival in infected cells. This has
      led the scientific community to explore the molecular mechanisms by which
      SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells, establishes productive infection, and
      causes life-threatening pathophysiology. Very few targeted therapeutics
      for COVID-19 currently exist, such as remdesivir. Recently, a proteomic
      approach explored the interactions of 26 of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins with
      cellular targets in human cells and identified 67 interactions as
      potential targets for drug development. Two of the critical targets, the
      bromodomain and extra-terminal domain proteins (BETs): BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR,
      are inhibited by the dual inhibitory small molecule SF2523 at nanomolar
      potency. SF2523 is the only known mTOR PI3K-/(BRD2/BRD4) inhibitor with
      potential to block two orthogonal pathways necessary for SARS-CoV-2
      pathogenesis in human cells. Our results demonstrate that SF2523
      effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung bronchial epithelial
      cells in vitro, showing an IC50 value of 1.5 {micro}M, comparable to IC50
      value of remdesivir (1.1 {micro}M). Further, we demonstrated that the
      combination of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir is highly synergistic: it
      allows for the reduction of doses of SF2523 and remdesivir by 25-fold and
      4-fold, respectively, to achieve the same potency observed for a single
      inhibitor. Because SF2523 inhibits two SARS-CoV-2 driven pathogenesis
      mechanisms involving BRD2/BRD4 and mTOR signaling, our data suggest that
      SF2523 alone or in combination with remdesivir could be a novel and
      efficient therapeutic strategy to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence be
      beneficial in preventing severe COVID-19 disease evolution.


      One Sentence SummaryEvidence of in silico designed chemotype (SF2523) targeting PI3K-/mTOR/BRD4 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and is highly synergistic with remdesivir.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Genome-wide association analysis reveals extensive genetic overlap
      between mood instability and psychiatric disorders but divergent patterns
      of genetic effects
    category: psychiatry-and-clinical-psychology
    abstract: Mood instability (MOOD) is a transdiagnostic phenomenon with a
      prominent neurobiological basis. Recent genome-wide association studies
      found significant positive genetic correlation between MOOD and major
      depression (DEP) and weak correlations with other psychiatric disorders.
      We investigated the polygenic overlap between MOOD and psychiatric
      disorders beyond genetic correlation to better characterize putative
      shared genetic determinants. Summary statistics for schizophrenia (SCZ,
      n=105,318), bipolar disorder (BIP, n=413,466), DEP (n=450,619),
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n=53,293) and MOOD
      (n=363,705), were analysed using the bivariate causal mixture model and
      conjunctional false discovery rate methods to estimate the proportion of
      shared variants influencing MOOD and each disorder, and identify jointly
      associated genomic loci. MOOD correlated positively with all psychiatric
      disorders, but with wide variation in strength (rg=0.10-0.62). Of 10.4K
      genomic variants influencing MOOD, 4K-9.4K were estimated to influence
      psychiatric disorders. MOOD was jointly associated with DEP at 163 loci,
      SCZ at 110, BIP at 60 and ADHD at 25, with consistent genetic effects in
      independent samples. Fifty-three jointly associated loci were overlapping
      across two or more disorders (transdiagnostic), seven of which had
      discordant effect directions on psychiatric disorders. Genes mapped to
      loci associated with MOOD and all four disorders were enriched in a single
      gene-set, synapse organization. The extensive polygenic overlap indicates
      shared molecular underpinnings across MOOD and psychiatric disorders.
      However, distinct patterns of genetic correlation and effect directions of
      shared loci suggest divergent effects on corresponding neurobiological
      mechanisms which may relate to differences in the core clinical features
      of each disorder.

    title: Viral infection and Transmission in a large well-traced outbreak caused
      by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: We report the first local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant
      in mainland China. All 167 infections could be traced back to the first
      index case. Daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects
      indicated that the viral loads of Delta infections, when they first become
      PCR+, were on average ~1000 times greater compared to A/B lineage
      infections during initial epidemic wave in China in early 2020, suggesting
      potentially faster viral replication and greater infectiousness of Delta
      during early infection. We performed high-quality sequencing on samples
      from 126 individuals. Reliable epidemiological data meant that, for 111
      transmission events, the donor and recipient cases were known. The
      estimated transmission bottleneck size was 1-3 virions with most minor
      intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) failing to transmit to the
      recipients. However, transmission heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 was also
      observed. The transmission of minor iSNVs resulted in at least 4 of the 30
      substitutions identified in the outbreak, highlighting the contribution of
      intra-host variants to population level viral diversity during rapid
      spread. Disease control activities, such as the frequency of population
      testing, quarantine during pre-symptomatic infection, and level of virus
      genomic surveillance should be adjusted in order to account for the
      increasing prevalence of the Delta variant worldwide.

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    title: Egg size variation in a long-lived polyandrous shorebird in the context
      of senescence and breeding phenology
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: "Anisogamy is a central component of sex role evolution, however, the
      effect of female-female mating competition on egg size variation in
      polyandrous species is unclear. Moreover, egg size may also be shaped by
      age-dependent trade-offs between reproductive investments and somatic
      maintenance that are responsible for senescence. Here we investigate how
      mating behaviour and senescence are associated with egg size variation in
      female snowy plovers (Charadrius nivosus). Snowy plovers are long-lived
      shorebirds (longevity record: 20 years) that often produce several nests
      each year, with females either sequentially changing partners between
      breeding attempts or remaining monogamous between attempts. We examined
      how age, seasonality, body size, and mating behaviour relate to within-
      and between-female variation in egg volume using repeated measures
      collected over a 15-year period. We found no evidence of reproductive
      senescence in egg volume in snowy plover females. Rather, egg volume,
      polyandry, and re-nesting were strongly linked to breeding phenology:
      early breeding females had a higher likelihood of being polyandrous or
      replacing failed clutches, yet these individuals laid smaller eggs likely
      due to physiological limitations associated with the early season. Older
      individuals and local recruits secured the earliest breeding opportunities
      in the season suggesting that prior experience could give an edge in the
      female-female competition for mates. Larger females laid the largest eggs,
      as expected, but there was no relationship between body size and lay date
      - implying that size may not provide an advantage in female-female
      competition. Our findings highlight the existence of several direct and
      indirect constraints on female reproductive investment that likely shape
      individual variation in lifetime reproductive success. Future research
      investigating reproductive senescence of wild populations should consider
      mating system dynamics when examining variation in reproductive
      investment."

    abstract: A classic view of the striatum holds that activity in direct and
      indirect pathways oppositely modulates motor output. Whether this involves
      direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying
      movement, has remained unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent
      control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS)
      depends on a task's cognitive demands. Furthermore, a latent state model
      (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals
      that - even within a single task - the contribution of the two pathways to
      behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large
      contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence
      accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating
      previous choices. Thus, both the cognitive demands imposed by a task, as
      well as the strategy that mice pursue within a task, determine whether DMS
      pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.

    title: Polyandry and senescence shape egg size variation in a precocial bird.
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: >-
      Identifying age-dependent trade-offs between reproductive effort and
      survival in wild organisms is central for understanding the evolutionary
      mechanisms of senescence. According to the disposable soma theory,
      early-life energy investments in reproduction compromise late-life
      investments in somatic maintenance - leading to senescence. Once thought
      to only be detectable in captive populations, senescence has recently been
      documented by several longitudinal studies of wild organisms. However,
      some reproductive traits that are used to quantify senescence may also be
      shaped by other age-dependent processes such as mating tactics. For
      instance, polygamy, which is often positively associated with age, may
      lead to reduced gamete size due to trade-offs between gamete quantity and
      quality. Here we investigate how mating behaviour and senescence are
      associated with reproductive trade-offs of female snowy plovers
      (Charadrius nivosus). Snowy plovers are long-lived shorebirds (longevity
      record: 19 years) that produce several nests each year, with females
      either being polyandrous and sequentially changing partners between
      breeding attempts or remaining monogamous between attempts. We examined
      how age, seasonality, and mating tactics affect within-female variation in
      egg volume using repeated measures collected over a 14-year period. Our
      results provide clear evidence for senescence in snowy plover females
      starting at three years of age. Furthermore, females laid smaller eggs in
      years when they were polyandrous compared to years when they were
      monogamous, with early- and late-season clutches having the smallest eggs.
      We suggest that individual female reproductive performance is regulated by
      flexible mating tactics and age- and season-dependent effects. Our
      findings highlight the existence of multiple trade-offs for female
      reproductive investments that likely shape individual variation in
      lifetime reproductive success. We encourage future research investigating
      reproductive senescence of wild populations to incorporate age-dependent
      reproductive investments in light of mating system dynamics.

    title: "Efficacy of Proxalutamide in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A
      Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel-Design Clinical
      Trial"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity is mediated by the androgen-promoted protease,
      transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Previously, we have shown that
      treatment with proxalutamide, a non-steroidal androgen receptor
      antagonist, accelerates viral clearance and clinical remission in
      outpatients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) compared to placebo.
      The effects in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were unknown. Methods: Men
      and women hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation were
      randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive 300 mg of proxalutamide per day or
      placebo for 14 days. The study was conducted at eight sites in the state
      of Amazonas, Brazil. The primary outcome measure was the clinical status
      (8-point ordinal scale) at 14-days post-randomization. The primary
      efficacy endpoint was the 14-day recovery ratio (alive hospital discharge
      [scores 1, 2]). Findings: A total of 645 patients were randomized (317
      received proxalutamide, 328 placebo) and underwent intention-to-treat
      analysis. The 14-day median ordinal scale score in the proxalutamide group
      was 1 (interquartile range [IQR]=1-2) versus 7 (IQR=2-8) for placebo,
      P<0.001. The 14-day recovery rate was 81.4% for proxalutamide and 35.7%
      for placebo (recovery ratio, 2.28; 95% CI 1.95-2.66 [P<0.001]). The 28-day
      all-cause mortality rate was 11.0% for proxalutamide versus 49.4% for
      placebo (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI 0.11-0.24). The median
      post-randomization time to recovery was 5 days (IQR=3-8) for proxalutamide
      versus 10 days (IQR=6-15) for placebo. Interpretation: Hospitalized
      COVID-19 patients not requiring mechanical ventilation receiving
      proxalutamide had a 128% higher recovery rate than those treated with
      placebo. All-cause mortality was reduced by 77.7% over 28 days.

    raw_message: "Dear Olavo Amaral, thank you for your question, and for the
      opportunity to clarify that even further. The 3 Manaus sites had
      randomized distribution throughout the trial, starting at 1:1, and only
      after bulk, blinded, randomized distribution to 2 sites with 50 treatment
      boxes of a single arm, the randomization in Manaus accumulated the other
      arm. At the last week of enrollment in Manaus, the randomization was
      greatly unbalanced. Bulk shipping caused bulk accumulation. Just to
      facilitate understanding to the readers... I'll give you an easy imaginary
      example: If you had a bag of Christmas M&M with same amount of green and
      red M&Ms. You start a blinded distribution at random. Then, a shipment has
      to be done of 50 M&M of the same color... at a 1:1 random chance: A Red vs
      Green coin toss is performed. Coin is tossed: Red.... someone unblinded
      who does not interact with the participants removes 50 red M&M from the
      bag, and ship it by airplane to a remote city of the Amazon. The bag now
      has more green (and investigators and patients don't know), and the
      blinded, random distribution continues. Then you do it again, at random,
      1:1 chance: it was red again... 50 reds again (randomly assigned by
      chance)... by the end of the bag, even though the chances of assigning
      green are higher, the distribution is still at random.**** As discussed in
      the manuscript, the uneven distribution between sites is likely a bias
      that favored the PLACEBO ARM, as hospitals with more structure (Manaus)
      ended up receiving more PLACEBO, by chance. For future trials with similar
      difficulties, we would advise investigators to attempt \"sequential\"
      distribution of boxes to remote sites (A-B-A-B-A-B-A). Bulk distribution
      of a single arm to remote sites was crucial to ensure the all patients
      took 14 days of the same arm, without confusion or sharing. We hope that
      the future studies with antiandrogens for covid19 don't have the same
      logistic and dispensing hurdles."

    title: "Necessity of COVID-19 Vaccination in Previously Infected Individuals: A
      Retrospective Cohort Study"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: There are good reasons to expect natural infection to
      provide protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in
      persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Employees of the
      Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously
      infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the
      second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next four months, among previously infected
      subjects who received the vaccine, was compared with those of previously
      infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected
      subjects who received the vaccine, and previously uninfected subjects who
      remained unvaccinated. Results: Among the 52238 included employees, 1220
      (47%) of 2579 previously infected subjects received the vaccine, compared
      with 29461 (59%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ among previously infected
      unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated,
      and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and was much lower
      than that of previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not
      one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had
      a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. Conclusion:
      Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from
      COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
      have not been infected before."

    raw_message: The reinfection rate using all "possible reinfections" was 0.4%
      with infection defined as positive test, not the original definition of
      COVID-19 which is illness symptoms plus positive test.  This is superior
      to the infection rates after two doses of mRNA vaccine, the current gold
      standard for vaccine effectiveness.  In a large multi-center prospective
      cohort study of previously infected UK NHS workers, prior infection was
      93% effective at preventing reinfection in a group much more exposed to
      infection risk than those participating in mRNA vaccine trials. This is
      science that is not being followed under current vaccination guidelines.

    title: Inferring the number of COVID-19 cases from recently reported deaths
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: We estimate the number of COVID-19 cases from newly reported deaths in
      a population without previous reports. Our results suggest that by the
      time a single death occurs, hundreds to thousands of cases are likely to
      be present in that population. This suggests containment via contact
      tracing will be challenging at this point, and other response strategies
      should be considered. Our approach is implemented in a publicly available,
      user-friendly, online tool.

    raw_message: Thank you very much for sharing this paper. I am interested to know
      what lag time was assumed between infections and deaths when calculating
      or inferring the CFR figures. Was it possible to use a distribution of
      variable lag times, based on real life data, for more sophisticated
      modelling? Also, has the lag time increased and/or CFR decreased as new
      medical interventions have slowed down the rapid onset of Covid-19 for
      severe cases requiring hospitalisation, since the beginning of the
      pandemic?

    title: Mask mandate and use efficacy in state-level COVID-19 containment
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
      evidence-based strategies to reduce transmission. Because COVID-19 can
      spread via respired droplets, many states have mandated mask use in public
      settings. Randomized control trials have not clearly demonstrated mask
      efficacy against respiratory viruses, but observational studies suggest
      greater mask compliance may be associated with lower infection rates. We
      hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use are associated with
      lower COVID-19 case growth rates in the United States. Methods: We
      calculated total COVID-19 case growth and mask use for the continental
      United States with data from the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We estimated
      post-mask mandate case growth in non-mandate states using median issuance
      dates of neighboring states with mandates. Results: Case growth was not
      significantly different between mandate and non-mandate states at low or
      high transmission rates, and surges were equivocal. Mask use predicted
      lower case growth at low, but not high transmission rates. Growth rates
      were comparable between states in the top and bottom mask use quintiles
      adjusted for normalized total cases early in the pandemic and unadjusted
      after peak Fall-Winter infections. Mask use did not predict Summer 2020
      case growth for non-Northeast states or Fall-Winter 2020 growth for all
      states. Conclusions: Mask mandates and use are not associated with slower
      state-level COVID-19 spread during COVID-19 growth surges. COVID-19
      containment requires future research and implementation of existing
      efficacious strategies."

      We have a problem here, DaveGinOly, with you not sticking with the topic
      of mask-wearing and fretting about what may be some flaw in my
      understanding of something you feel to be an expert on -- and yet you cite
      nothing to back up anything you say. My "pull quote" says nothing about
      me, and my shortcomings, whatever they may be, have very little to do, in
      the grand scheme of things, with the pandemic. 


      The study started with the fact that mask wearing stopped the flu from spreading, and used known factors to plug into the simulation. It was not the reverse, that there was a simulation, based on a hypothetical model, to show how mask wearing might hypothetically work.


      It's saying, now that we know the effect of mask wearing on this past season's spread of the flu, we can attempt a simulation of previous years. It's like saying, if only our team's unsuccessful goalie blocked as many shots as some successful goalie, we would have won such-and-so more games and been champions. So let's get a better goalie for upcoming years.


      You are incorrect about the real world results. The study starts with real world results, and simulates what this could have meant for previous years.


      FYI, within the same state, and you choose the state, we know that mask wearing has helped cities get out of the "red". Double masking has been shown to prevent both the contraction and, when contracted, the severity of the virus. We also know which mask ought go on top when doing so.

    title: Interim Report of a Phase 2 Randomized Trial of a Plant-Produced
      Virus-Like Particle Vaccine for Covid-19 in Healthy Adults Aged 18-64 and
      Older Adults Aged 65 and Older
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally continues to impact humanity
      on a global scale with rising morbidity and mortality. Despite the
      development of multiple effective vaccines, new vaccines continue to be
      required to supply ongoing demand. We report Day 42 interim safety and
      immunogenicity data from a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      in Adults aged 18+ immunized with a virus-like particle vaccine candidate
      produced in plants displaying SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CoVLP)
      adjuvanted with AS03 (NCT04636697). This report focuses on presenting
      safety, tolerability and immunogenicity, as measured by neutralizing
      antibody (NAb) and cell mediated immunity (IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 ELISpot)
      responses, in Adults aged 18-64 (Adults) and Older Adults aged 65+ (Older
      Adults). CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was well-tolerated and adverse events
      (AE) were primarily mild or moderate and of transient duration. AEs in
      Older Adults were more limited than those observed in the Adult
      population. CoVLP with AS03 induced a significant humoral immune response
      in both age cohorts. CoVLP with AS03 induced a greater humoral response in
      Adults than Older Adults after a single dose but this effect was overcome
      with a second dose when both age cohorts responded with NAb titers that
      were ~10-fold higher than those in a panel of sera from patients
      recovering from COVID-19. A single dose of CoVLP with AS03 induced a
      significant IFN-{gamma} response in both age cohorts; a second dose
      significantly boosted IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 responses in both age cohorts.
      Adults generated a stronger IFN-{gamma} and IL-4 cellular response than
      did Older Adults after one or two doses of AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP. Safety
      and immunogenicity from Adults with comorbidities as well as final safety
      and immunogenicity responses after 12 months will be reported upon
      availability.

    raw_message: So far, so good.  No infectious agents added to the SARS-2 shot,
      that's a plus, and if Phase 3 goes as well this Medicago-GSK shot may be
      safe enough for many I know to take, with so many possibly having SARS-2
      already but no way to prove it since tests are garbage and antibody tests
      are about 50% accurate at best.  Safety over hype.  People I work with
      cannot take any SARS-2 shots due to medical conditions they have but
      they're being treated like cattle, horrible.

      Fair enough. A ruthlessly non-politiccal assessment of the quality of scientific evidence will be the most significant portion of the research. Perhaps you might add to the discussion portion of your research paper the impact of basing policy on evidennce that does not meet the standard for policy-grade evidence. This is a very important discussion. Policy-makers seem to be ignorant of the standards necessary to draw conclusions that then can translate into sound policies for public health. They seem to have fallen into the trap of self-perpetuating policies that become untethered from an assessment of the quality of evidence.


      Wishing you luck and good fortune in your pursuit of a  worthy goal re quality of evidence.

    abstract: We acquired a rapidly preserved human surgical sample from the
      temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. We stained a 1 mm3 volume with heavy
      metals, embedded it in resin, cut more than 5000 slices at ~30 nm and
      imaged these sections using a high-speed multibeam scanning electron
      microscope. We used computational methods to render the three-dimensional
      structure of 50,000 cells, hundreds of millions of neurites and 133.7
      million synaptic connections. The 1.4 petabyte electron microscopy volume,
      the segmented cells, cell parts, blood vessels, myelin, inhibitory and
      excitatory synapses, and 100 manually proofread cells are available to
      peruse online. Despite the incompleteness of the automated segmentation
      caused by split and merge errors, many interesting features were evident.
      Glia outnumbered neurons 2:1 and oligodendrocytes were the most common
      cell type in the volume. The E:I balance of neurons was 69:31%, similar to
      the ratio of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses in the volume, which
      was 63:37%. The E:I ratio of synapses was significantly higher on
      pyramidal neurons than inhibitory interneurons. We found that deep layer
      excitatory cell types can be classified into subsets, based on structural
      and connectivity differences, that chandelier interneurons not only
      innervate excitatory neuron initial segments as previously described, but
      also each others initial segments. Furthermore, among the thousands of
      weak connections established on each neuron, there exist rarer highly
      powerful axonal inputs that establish multi-synaptic contacts (up to ~20
      synapses) with target neurons. Our analysis indicates that these strong
      inputs are specific, and allow small numbers of axons to have an outsized
      role in the activity of some of their postsynaptic partners.

      We will include only studies that provide proof of transmission outcome using culturable virus and /or genetic sequencing. The inclusion of this higher-quality evidence aims to overcome the methodological shortcomings of lower quality studies. We will assess the microbiologic or genetic sequencing evidence in an effort to inform the quality of the chain of transmission evidence and adequacy of follow up of sign and symptom monitoring.


      This is reasonable and, in my view, essential.


      Also, the malady for which the infection is the cause must be very well ldefined. It would be false to claim that a person was pre-symptomatic if they did not present the definitive symptoms arrayed in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. Lack of symptoms specific to this particular malady would exclude the individual from the chain of transmission. In effect, the research must be based on the SARS patient and then work back from that. NOT the other way around, which depends on speculations and non-specificity.


      Likelihood is that you will end up making a rather vague analysis on influenza-like illness the symptoms of which may be presented in the chain of transmission toward an endpoint where the patient suffered influenza-like respiratory distress. The challenge you face is distinguishing that sort of chain from the chain specific to SARS-COV-2; and that means facing the ambiguities that define a distinction, such as it may be, between SARS-COV-1 and influenza and between SARS-COV-1 AND SARS-COV-2. If patients fall into a category that incudes infuenza-like illness, then, that places a heavy limitation on your research. It is the same limitation that applies to most of the research regarding what was deemed, by mere assertion alone, a new or novel pathogen.


      This must be addressed.

    title: Development of an oral swab based microbiome test for the detection of
      feline dental disease
    category: genomics
    abstract: Variations in the microbial composition of the mouth (the oral
      microbiome) have known associations with dental and systemic disease.
      While this is relatively well understood in humans, research on this topic
      in companion animals, and in cats in particular, has been limited. In this
      study, we used oral microbiome data obtained from shotgun metagenomic
      sequencing of 38,000 cats (data gathered through a direct-to-consumer cat
      DNA testing platform) to reveal the staggering diversity of the feline
      oral microbiome, identifying 8,344 microbial species across the entire
      cohort. We used a subset of these data points (6,110 cats) to develop a
      feline dental health test able to assess whether a cat is at risk of
      having periodontal disease, tooth resorption and halitosis based on their
      oral microbiome. After filtering out classified microbial reads with low
      abundance, we were able to detect, on average, 606 microbes per oral
      microbiome sample, identifying not just bacteria, but also viruses, fungi,
      archaea and protozoa. Due to the shortage of available published research
      on the microbial signature of tooth resorption and halitosis in cats, we
      used our periodontal disease feline cohort (n=570) to validate our
      approach. We observed microbial compositional abundance trends consistent
      with previously reported findings from feline, canine and human studies on
      periodontal disease. We used compositional abundance-based statistical
      methods relying on pairwise log-ratio (PLR) transformation to identify
      microbes significantly correlated with each of the three dental conditions
      of interest. We identified a set of 27 microbes that are predictive for
      all three dental conditions, as well as microbes specifically predictive
      of periodontal disease, tooth resorption or halitosis. We used the
      compositional abundance profiles of predictive microbes to develop a risk
      score based model assessing the probability that a cat is suffering from
      each of the three dental conditions. The model had highest sensitivity for
      halitosis (72%) and highest specificity for tooth resorption (78%).
      Lastly, we observed relatively consistent dental disease risk profiles
      when we compared data from sample collection methods targeting the whole
      mouth versus those targeting the gum line specifically. In contrast,
      samples collected in triplicates from the same cats using a sampling
      method targeting the whole mouth showed more variation in the generated
      risk profiles. This was likely due to a failure to consistently collect
      sufficient sample material from areas of the mouth where microbes relevant
      to dental pathology would be found in highest amounts (i.e., the gum
      line). For this reason, we have modified the instructions of the test to
      emphasize the importance of targeting the gum line during sample
      collection. Regular at home or in clinic screening with the feline dental
      health test described in this study has the potential to facilitate early
      detection and prevention of dental disease.

      Hi,


      Thank you very much for posting this preprint.


      I can think of a number of questions, but I hope these are the most important:


      <b>1)</b> I noticed that you filter for samples with “<i>>10,000 and <500,000 classified microbial reads</i>.”


      <b>Does this filter also apply to returning results to customers?</b>


      Based upon data / results I will mention in <b>2)</b>, I believe my cat’s samples may have had <a href="https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/blob/master/basepaws_Dental_Health_Test/HCWGS0003.23.HCWGS0003_Kraken2.kreport">~25% bacterial reads</a> (at least for the ~15% WGS sample).  For the earlier lcWGS samples (for “Health + Breed” kits), I thought they were 2-4 million reads each.  If the Dental Health Test was similar, then I think my cat’s sample(s) would have had “<i><500,000 classified microbial reads</i>”.  However, I am not sure if I am misunderstanding something?


      <b>2)</b> You can see the various measurements for my 1 cat here:


      <a href="https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/tree/master/basepaws_Dental_Health_Test">https://github.com/cwarden45/Bastu_Cat_Genome/tree/master/basepaws_Dental_Health_Test</a>


      My question is whether there is some figure in this preprint that I can use to compare the scores for my cat (or <b><i>any</i> customer can do for their cat</b>), compared to the density distributions cases and controls used for the risk estimation in this paper (for what I might call a training set)?


      I am also curious if those proportions say consistent among batches (and filtered samples or full samples, if they are all returned to customers).


      I think this might be similar to <b>Figure 3</b>, but I am not sure how to map the scores for my cat.


      <b>3)</b> Relative to the ordinary sample collection, is anything added to the liquid to limit or prevent<b> post-collection bacterial blooms</b>?


      If something was already added, is there any evidence that helps restrict / prevent bacterial growth from earlier tests?


      <b>4)</b> The Competing Interest Statement currently says “<i>The authors have declared no competing interest</i>”.  However, because you are working for a company that offers a Dental Health Test based upon these results, I believe you need to declare a <b>competing interest</b>.  Is there something that I might be missing?


      Thanks again!


      Sincerely,

      Charles

    title: "The evidence on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from pre- and
      asymptomatic cases: protocol for a systematic review. (Version 2 modified
      on 6 July 2021)"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background The role of cases of SARS-CoV-2 who remain without
      symptoms throughout the active phase of the disease (asymptomatics) and
      those who have not developed symptoms yet when surveyed (pre-symptomatics)
      is at present unclear, despite the important role that they may play in
      infecting third parties. There is also a lack of clarity on the role of
      pauci-symptomatic persons with COVID-19 and the degree to which they may
      be associated with transmission compared to fully symptomatic persons.
      Methods We will search LitCovid, medRxiv, Google Scholar and the WHO
      Covid-19 database using Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, transmission, and
      appropriate synonyms as search terms. We will also search the reference
      lists of included studies are searched for additional relevant studies. We
      will include studies of people exposed to SARS CoV-2 within 2-14 days
      (incubation time) of close contact or suspected community or institutional
      exposure to index asymptomatic infected individuals, as defined in each
      study with secondary case(s) infected. We will only include studies which
      provide microbiological proof of transmission outcome (culturable virus
      and /or genic sequencing). The inclusion of higher-quality evidence should
      overcome the methodological shortcomings of lower quality studies. We will
      assess quality of the chain of transmission evidence, microbiological
      proof and adequacy of follow up and symptom monitoring. Expected results
      We intend to present the evidence in three distinct packages: study
      description, methodological quality assessment and data extracted. We
      intend summarising the evidence and drawing conclusions"

    raw_message: The research should not use PCR or tests derived of PCR for
      assessing 1-Infection 2-infectiousness 3-illness. If the research depends
      on flawed data, at its root, then, the conclusions drawn will be no
      better. First establish what you are actually looking for - an intact
      viral particle that can be cultured. Further, establish that each supposed
      transmission be verified using such a method. And, de4fine the actual
      illness that is supposed to be directly associated with the pathogen you
      are looking for; that means a syndrome of acute severe respiratory
      distress.  Not a cough or a wheeze; not a fever; not a symptom that is
      applicable to many other potential causes. So make the causal relationship
      front and center. Specifically identify and test for the particular causal
      agent; specifically verify illness caused by that causal agent. Failing
      that, your research will be for nothing specific - not for a specific
      infection, not for a specific transmission, not for a specific malady.
      This should be noted in the strenghts/weakness portion of any research
      paper produced from your efforts.

    title: "Post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection: risk factors and illness profile
      in a prospective, observational community-based case-control study"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: "Background: Both BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines show good efficacy in
      clinical trials and real-world data. However, some still contract
      SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination. This study identifies risk factors associated
      with SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 14 days after first vaccination and
      describes characteristics of post-vaccination illness. Methods: Cases were
      UK adults reporting post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection between 8th
      December 2020 and 1st May 2021, reporting on the COVID Symptom Study app.
      We assessed the associations of age, frailty, comorbidity, area-level
      deprivation and lifestyle factors with infection (vaccinated cases vs.
      negative-vaccinated controls); and vaccination with illness profile
      (vaccinated cases vs positive-unvaccinated controls). Findings:
      Post-vaccination infection risk was substantially higher in older adults
      with frailty (OR= 2.78, 95% CI [1.98-3.89], p-value<0.0001) and in
      individuals living in most deprived areas (OR vs. intermediate group=1.22,
      95%CI [1.04-1.43], p-value=0.01). Risk was lower in individuals with a
      healthier diet (OR=0.73, 95%CI [0.62-0.86], p-value<0.0001) and without
      obesity (OR=0.6, 95% CI [0.44-0.82], p-value=0.001). Vaccination was
      associated with reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR=0.36, 95%CI
      [0.28-0.46], p-value<0.0001), and high acute-symptom burden (OR=0.51,
      95%CI [0.42-0.61], p-value<0.0001). In the 60+ age group, risk of >28 days
      illness was lower following vaccination (OR=0.72 , 95%CI [0.51-1.00],
      p-value=0.05). Most symptoms were reported less in positive-vaccinated vs.
      positive-unvaccinated individuals, except sneezing, which was more common
      post-vaccination (OR=1.24, 95%CI [1.05-1.46], p-value=0.01).
      Interpretation: Our findings highlight reduced symptom burden and duration
      in those infected post-vaccination. Whilst reassuring, our data should
      prompt efforts to boost vaccine effectiveness in at-risk populations;
      moreover, targeted infection control measures will still be appropriate to
      minimise SARS-CoV-2 infection."

      Shouldn't that be

      This is what I gathered from the text, and it makes more sense.

    title: "Ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials"
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: We systematically assessed benefits and harms of the use
      of ivermectin (IVM) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Published and preprint
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19
      adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary
      outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse
      events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs.
      We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Inverse
      variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of
      evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by
      severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up
      were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were
      standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample
      size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and
      severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and
      mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs.
      controls (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.16-7.65, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS
      vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs,
      severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low
      QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroup analyses by severity of COVID-19
      disease or RoB were consistent with main analyses. Sensitivity analyses
      excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause
      mortality but diminished heterogeneity (I2=0%). Conclusions: In comparison
      to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay
      or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease.
      IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to
      treat COVID-19 patients."

      My comment submitted 7/27/2021:


      The following letter from Tess Lawrie et al. strongly rebuts this review by Roman et al. I highly recommend reading the letter as it is succinct and presents damning points:


      “With misreporting of source data, highly selective study inclusion, ‘cherry picking’ of data within included studies, and conclusions that do not follow from the evidence, this article amounts to disinformation... We respectfully request investigation, and retraction of the article as it stands.”


      I join the letter’s signatories in calling for swift retraction. Thank you for your consideration.

    title: Promoter-sequence determinants and structural basis of primer-dependent
      transcription initiation in Escherichia coli
    category: biochemistry
    abstract: Chemical modifications of RNA 5' ends enable "epitranscriptomic"
      regulation, influencing multiple aspects of RNA fate. In transcription
      initiation, a large inventory of substrates compete with nucleoside
      triphosphates (NTPs) for use as initiating entities, providing an ab
      initio mechanism for altering the RNA 5' end. In Escherichia coli cells,
      RNAs with a 5'-end hydroxyl are generated by use of dinucleotide RNAs as
      primers for transcription initiation, "primer-dependent initiation." Here
      we use massively systematic transcript end readout ("MASTER") to detect
      and quantify RNA 5' ends generated by primer-dependent initiation for ~410
      (~1,000,000) promoter sequences in E. coli. The results show
      primer-dependent initiation in E. coli involves any of the 16 possible
      dinucleotide primers and depends on promoter sequences in, upstream, and
      downstream of the primer binding site. The results yield a consensus
      sequence for primer dependent initiation, YTSS-2NTSS-1NTSSWTSS+1, where
      TSS is the transcription start site, NTSS-1NTSS is the primer binding
      site, Y is pyrimidine, and W is A or T. Biochemical and
      structure-determination studies show that the base pair
      (nontemplate-strand base:template-strand base) immediately upstream of the
      primer binding site (Y:RTSS-2, where R is purine) exerts its effect
      through the base on the DNA template strand (RTSS-2) through inter-chain
      base stacking with the RNA primer. Results from analysis of a large set of
      natural, chromosomally-encoded E. coli promoters support the conclusions
      from MASTER. Our findings provide a mechanistic and structural description
      of how TSS-region sequence hard-codes not only the TSS position, but also
      the potential for epitranscriptomic regulation through primer dependent
      transcription initiation.

    title: "Adolescent Development of Biological Rhythms: Estradiol Dependence and
      Effects of Combined Contraceptives"
    category: physiology
    abstract: "Purpose: Adolescence is a period of continuous development, including
      the maturation of endogenous rhythms across systems and timescales.
      Although these dynamic changes are well recognized, their continuous
      structure and hormonal dependence have not been systematically
      characterized. Given the well-established link between core body
      temperature (CBT) and reproductive hormones in adults, we hypothesized
      that high-resolution CBT can be applied to passively monitor pubertal
      development and disruption with high fidelity. Methods: To examine this
      possibility, we used signal processing to investigate the trajectory of
      CBT rhythms at the within-day (ultradian), daily (circadian), and
      ovulatory timescales, their dependence on estradiol, and the effects of
      hormonal contraceptives. Results: Puberty onset was marked by a rise in
      fecal estradiol (fE2), followed by an elevation in CBT and circadian
      power. This time period marked the commencement of 4-day rhythmicity in
      fE2, CBT, and ultradian power marking the onset of the estrous cycle. The
      rise in circadian amplitude was accelerated by E2 treatment, indicating a
      role for this hormone in rhythmic development. Contraceptive
      administration in later adolescence reduced CBT and circadian power and
      resulted in disruption to 4-day cycles that persisted after
      discontinuation. Conclusions: Our data reveal with precise temporal
      resolution how biological rhythms change across adolescence and
      demonstrate a role for E2 in the emergence and preservation of multiscale
      rhythmicity. These findings also demonstrate how hormones delivered
      exogenously in a non-rhythmic pattern can disrupt rhythmic development.
      These data lay the groundwork for a future in which temperature metrics
      provide an inexpensive, convenient method for monitoring pubertal
      maturation and support the development of hormone therapies that better
      mimic and support human chronobiology."

      Interesting paper with exciting results. There are certainly valuable
      implications from these findings.  After reading through, I had several
      comments that I thought I would share.  


      1. Add legend to figure 1 x axis, “Days”. Perhaps p-day would be useful.

      2. Is it standard to have text labels describing the results as seen in figure 2?

      3. What is the purpose of the colored arrows in figure 2?

      4. What is meant by ‘significant trend’ in figure 2/4? What test was used to determine this? Probably will need to clarify this statement

    abstract: Nucleic acid nanodevices present great potential as agents for
      logic-based therapeutic intervention as well as in basic biology. Often,
      however, the disease targets that need corrective action are localized in
      specific organs and thus realizing the full potential of DNA nanodevices
      also requires ways to target them to specific cell-types in vivo. Here we
      show that by exploiting either endogenous or synthetic receptor-ligand
      interactions and by leveraging the biological barriers presented by the
      organism, we can target extraneously introduced DNA nanodevices to
      specific cell types in C. elegans, with sub-cellular precision. The
      amenability of DNA nanostructures to tissue-specific targeting in vivo
      significantly expands their utility in biomedical applications and
      discovery biology.

    title: Viral infection and Transmission in a large well-traced outbreak caused
      by the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: We report the first local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant
      in mainland China. All 167 infections could be traced back to the first
      index case. Daily sequential PCR testing of the quarantined subjects
      indicated that the viral loads of Delta infections, when they first become
      PCR+, were on average ~1000 times greater compared to A/B lineage
      infections during initial epidemic wave in China in early 2020, suggesting
      potentially faster viral replication and greater infectiousness of Delta
      during early infection. We performed high-quality sequencing on samples
      from 126 individuals. Reliable epidemiological data meant that, for 111
      transmission events, the donor and recipient cases were known. The
      estimated transmission bottleneck size was 1-3 virions with most minor
      intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) failing to transmit to the
      recipients. However, transmission heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 was also
      observed. The transmission of minor iSNVs resulted in at least 4 of the 30
      substitutions identified in the outbreak, highlighting the contribution of
      intra-host variants to population level viral diversity during rapid
      spread. Disease control activities, such as the frequency of population
      testing, quarantine during pre-symptomatic infection, and level of virus
      genomic surveillance should be adjusted in order to account for the
      increasing prevalence of the Delta variant worldwide.

    title: "Risk of Myocarditis from COVID-19 Infection in People Under Age 20: A
      Population-Based Analysis"
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: Background There have been recent reports of myocarditis (including
      myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis) as a side-effect of
      mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in young males. Less
      information is available regarding the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19
      infection itself. Such data would be helpful in developing a complete
      risk-benefit analysis for this population. Methods A de-identified,
      limited data set was created from the TriNetX Research Network,
      aggregating electronic health records from 48 mostly large U.S. Healthcare
      Organizations (HCOs). Inclusion criteria were a first COVID-19 diagnosis
      during the April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021 time period, with an outpatient
      visit 1 month to 2 years before, and another 6 months to 2 years before
      that. Analysis was stratified by sex and age (12-17, 12-15, 16-19).
      Patients were excluded for any prior cardiovascular condition. Primary
      outcome was an encounter diagnosis of myocarditis within 90 days following
      the index date. Rates of COVID-19 cases and myocarditis not identified in
      the system were estimated and the results adjusted accordingly. Wilson
      score intervals were used for 95% confidence intervals due to the very low
      probability outcome. Results For the 12-17-year-old male cohort, 6/6,846
      (0.09%) patients developed myocarditis overall, with an adjusted rate per
      million of 876 cases (Wilson score interval 402 - 1,911). For the 12-15
      and 16-19 male age groups, the adjusted rates per million were 601 (257 -
      1,406) and 561 (240 - 1,313). For 12-17-year-old females, there were 3
      (0.04%) cases of myocarditis of 7,361 patients. The adjusted rate was 213
      (73 - 627) per million cases. For the 12-15- and 16-19-year-old female
      cohorts the adjusted rates per million cases were 235 (64 - 857) and 708
      (359 - 1,397). The outcomes occurred either within 5 days (40.0%) or from
      19-82 days (~60.0%). Conclusions Myocarditis (or pericarditis or
      myopericarditis) from primary COVID19 infection occurred at a rate as high
      as 450 per million in young males. Young males infected with the virus are
      up 6 times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who have received
      the vaccine.

      Some remarks:

      - confidence intervals would be necessary when interpolating data from such small numbers

      - 90 days is a long period after a positive test for an acute event…

      - if you want to compare these numbers to vaccine-caused myo/pericarditis, you need to use the same method (same criteria and same codes) to determine these

    title: Bacteria are everywhere, even in your COI marker gene data!
    category: bioinformatics
    abstract: The mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene (COI) is
      commonly used in eDNA metabarcoding studies, especially for assessing
      metazoan diversity. Yet, a great number of COI operational taxonomic units
      or/and amplicon sequence variants are retrieved from such studies and
      referred to as "dark matter", and do not get a taxonomic assignment with a
      reference sequence. For a thorough investigation of this dark matter, we
      have developed the Dark mAtteR iNvestigator (DARN) software tool. A
      reference COI-oriented phylogenetic tree was built from 1,240 consensus
      sequences covering all the three domains of life, with more than 80% of
      those representing eukaryotic taxa. With respect to eukaryotes, consensus
      sequences at the family level were constructed from 183,330 retrieved from
      the Midori reference 2 database. Similarly, sequences from 559 bacterial
      genera and 41 archaeal were retrieved from the BOLD database. DARN makes
      use of the phylogenetic tree to investigate and quantify pre-processed
      sequences of amplicon samples to provide both a tabular and a graphical
      overview of phylogenetic assignments. To evaluate DARN, both environmental
      and bulk metabarcoding samples from different aquatic environments using
      various primer sets were analysed. We demonstrate that a large proportion
      of non-target prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea are also
      amplified in eDNA samples and we suggest bacterial COI sequences to be
      included in the reference databases used for the taxonomy assignment to
      allow for further analyses of dark matter. DARN source code is available
      on GitHub at https://github.com/hariszaf/darn and you may find it as a
      Docker at https://hub.docker.com/r/hariszaf/darn.

      Hi,


      Thank you very much positing this preprint.


      I apologize if I overlooked something, but is your strategy doing something to try and gauge whether the "dark matter" is related to the COI gene or is off-target sequence that may be contamination?


      As one example, I think there have been periods of time where top BLAST hits for PhiX sequence have said something else (because the lab didn't realize the PhiX spike-in could barcode hop into samples): https://www.biostars.org/p/376585/#435110


      Or, even if the PhiX sequences are already filtered, do you think DARN can help with things like this post-publication review thread:


      https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42455-9#article-comments


      In that second example, you can do things like filter for sequences present in at least 2 reads in at least 1 sample.  However, you can also see some troubleshooting that I think might be somewhat more similar <a href="https://github.com/cwarden45/PRJNA513845-eDNA_reanalysis/tree/master/metagenomics">here</a>, and I am wondering if you think DARN might help identify groups of samples with a higher fraction of sequences that might not be a good representation the original biological sample.


      Thank you again!  I think the topic is quite interesting and important.


      Sincerely,

      Charles

    title: Progressive Increase in Virulence of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants in
      Ontario, Canada
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: The period from February to June 2021 was one during
      which initial wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strains were supplanted in Ontario,
      Canada, first by variants of concern (VOC) with the N501Y mutation
      (Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants), and then by the
      Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has
      been documented but data for increased virulence is limited. We used
      Ontario COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs
      compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 infections, as measured by risk of
      hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Methods:
      We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontarios testing positive
      for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between
      February 7 and June 22, 2021 (n=211,197). We constructed mixed effects
      logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission, and death
      as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for age, sex, time,
      comorbidities, and pregnancy status. Health units were included as random
      intercepts. Results: Compared to non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted
      elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 59% (49-69%)
      for hospitalization; 105% (82-134%) for ICU admission; and 61% (40-87%)
      for death. Increases with Delta variant were more pronounced: 120%
      (93-153%) for hospitalization; 287% (198-399%) for ICU admission; and 137%
      (50-230%) for death. Interpretation: The progressive increase in
      transmissibility and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will result in a
      significantly larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred
      in the absence of VOC emergence."

    raw_message: Thank you or your contribution! I still do not understand, how this
      works. If vaccination is interfering the ration between deaths from Delta
      and all the other variants, what is the study based on? Hard numbers shown
      are just those in table 1. How can a "lower death rate" cause a "higher
      death risk"? This for me only makes sense, if the time between infection
      and death is much longer for Delta. But there are no data presented
      supporting this thesis. I`m really confused here, especially because the
      German press and also the first "experts" forecast the end of the world
      because of this study. You don't find their results unreasonable, but did
      you find a proof for the conclusion "Delta ist more dangerous" in the
      paper? I didn`t..

    title: "Breakthrough Symptomatic COVID-19 Infections Leading to Long Covid:
      Report from Long Covid Facebook Group Poll"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing
      COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, a question remains whether
      vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of
      SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the
      Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on
      patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that
      asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949
      people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date.
      While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate
      rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to
      determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after
      breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases
      are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group
      (~169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll,
      44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that
      the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported
      to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.

    title: Effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines among Employees in an American
      Healthcare System
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: Background. The mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown great promise in
      clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
      effectiveness of these vaccines under real-world conditions in the USA.
      Methods. Employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System, previously not
      infected with SARS-CoV-2, and working in Ohio on Dec 16, 2020, the day
      COVID-19 vaccination began, were included. The cumulative incidence of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, over the next 5 months, was compared among those who
      received the vaccine and those who did not, by modeling vaccination as a
      time-dependent covariate in Cox proportional hazards regression analyses
      adjusted for the slope of the epidemic curve as a continuous
      time-dependent covariate. Results. Of the 46866 included employees, 28223
      (60%) were vaccinated by the end of the study period. The cumulative
      incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was much higher among those not
      vaccinated than those vaccinated. Only 15 (0.7%) of the 2154 SARS-CoV-2
      infections during the study occurred among those vaccinated. After
      adjusting for the slope of the epidemic curve, age, and job type,
      vaccination was associated with a significantly reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2
      infection (HR 0.03, 95% C.I. 0.02 - 0.06, p < 0.001), corresponding to a
      vaccine effectiveness rate of 97.1% (95% CI 94.3 - 98.5). Vaccine
      effectiveness was 89.2% at 7 days and 95.0% at 14 days after the first
      vaccine dose. Conclusions. The mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are over 97%
      protective against COVID-19 in the working-age population, with
      substantial protection possibly apparent within a few days of the first
      dose.

    title: Unrestrained growth of correctly oriented microtubules instructs axonal
      microtubule orientation
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: In many eukaryotic cells, directed molecular transport occurs along
      microtubules. Within neuronal axons, transport over vast distances
      particularly relies on uniformly oriented microtubules, whose plus-ends
      point towards the distal axon tip (+end out). However, axonal microtubules
      initially have mixed orientations, and what breaks this orientation
      symmetry is poorly understood. Using live imaging, physical modeling and
      simulations, we found that +end out microtubules surpass a growth
      transition and undergo persistent long-term growth. In contrast,
      oppositely oriented microtubules remain short. We confirmed experimentally
      and in silico that the enhanced growth of +end out microtubules is
      critical for achieving uniform microtubule orientation. Our data suggest
      that the accelerated growth kinetics of correctly oriented microtubules
      instructs overall axonal microtubule orientation, thus enabling efficient
      long-range transport essential for neuronal functioning.

      This is a really interesting article on a topic we tend to take for
      granted and then realise we (or at least I !) just hadn't thought about
      and certainly couldn't explain. Some mechanisms for microtubule polarity
      sorting in axons had been previously proposed but were recognised as being
      insufficient to fully explain the observations. Very nice original science
      with important implications for nervous system development, axon
      regeneration and neurodegenerative disease.



      <b>Summary of findings</b>



      Unlike dendrites, axons have microtubules that are almost all oriented with their growing (+) ends outwards. The mechanistic basis of this is not completely understood. Axonal microtubules are in a constant state of dynamic equilibrium, with their + ends growing but being subject to periodic ‘catastrophe’ that shortens them, either by dying back from their previously growing + ends or by severing them to create two 'daughter' microtubules, each with the potential for new growth. Unlike in other cell types, axonal microtubules are not attached to the centrosome but form a tiling array along the axon composed of individual microtubules from a few microns to over 100 microns in length (see work of Peter Baas and colleagues). Some kind of relationship between this dynamic equilibrium and selection of polarity appears likely but it has been unclear what that might be.



      To understand the mechanism, Jakobs et al used live imaging of microtubules in Drosophila axons in culture, labelled with EB1-GFP, which marks the growing tip. They find that during early axon growth in culture, microtubules with their + ends oriented distally have a growth advantage over those in the opposite orientation, so that over time + end-out becomes the dominant orientation. 



      First, they show that each microtubule growth events is (on average) longer if the microtubule is further distal in a growing axon and if the microtubule is oriented + end out. The difference between + end out, and in, microtubules is more marked distally. 



      Then, they measure the shrinkage distances in these same orientations and locations using double labelling of EB1 and tubulin. They use a mathematical model to show that + end-out oriented microtubules near growing tips have essentially unbounded growth (since the average growth event is longer in distance than the average shrinkage event), while in other locations and orientations average microtubule length stabilises because of the larger contribution of shrinkage events. 




      Using two methods to disrupt microtubule polymerisation (nocodazole and increased osmolarity) they then confirmed the importance of this +/- growth difference in establishing unipolarity. They also hypothesised that microtubule growth promoting proteins locally synthesised at the axon tip, such as p150, would explain the longer growth cycles of +end out oriented microtubules there, and supported this hypothesis with p150 knockdown and dominant negative mutants. Again, removing the growth length differential also removed the orientation difference.



      Finally, they address the orientation imbalance in more proximal axon regions that is less easy to explain based on a p150 gradient. They propose a model in which dynein-mediated sliding of – end out orientated microtubules towards the cell body, and templating of new microtubules, essentially matching existing orientation bias, could explain these differences. No additional data are presented for this part but it clearly forms a new hypothesis for further testing.



      <b>Implications</b>



      Axonal transport deficits are an important driver of axon loss and neurological deficits. For example, mutations in the anterograde motor protein KIF5A are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease and ALS, all disorders of long axon degeneration in which distal regions are affected first. Toxic blockade of axonal transport, for example in vincristine neuropathy, is also an important cause of axon damage. This article sheds light on the basic mechanisms that establish, and presumably also maintain effective, directional axonal transport. 



      Severe defects in this process of selection would be expected to result in failure of neuronal differentiation or axon growth. The likely phenotypic outcome of a severe defect would be embryonic lethality but partial defects could also occur and could therefore underlie disorders of axonal transport even if axons do initially form and carry out the process. Indeed, p150 mutations are associated with ALS. It would be really interesting to know how such mutations affect microtubule polarity and whether this underlies pathogenesis in these cases of ALS, or indeed in any other neurodegenerative disorders. It is challenging to address this in vivo, even in animal models, because of the requirement for live imaging of microtubule growth so I am not aware of any previous studies, but it is in principle an achievable aim now this mechanism has been identified.



      <b>Limitations</b>



      At present these findings are limited to Drosophila axons (seemingly dispersed starting from the entire CNS?) so it remains to be confirmed whether there are similar patterns in mammalian axons, and in different neuronal subtypes (e.g., CNS/PNS, motor/sensory, etc).



      <b>Minor suggestions for improvement</b>



      Just a presentational thing but in Fig 1E legend, would it be clearer to say ‘blue, right to left downwards’ than ‘blue, left to right upwards’ since these microtubule are in fact growing from right to left? Or probably the colour-coding explained in part D is already sufficient without this extra explanation? 



      A bit more introduction to what is templating and sliding would be helpful.



      It would be just marginally easier to follow without the switch in axon orientation between Figs 1-3 and Fig 4. But this is a minor point that perhaps just keeps our reversal learning sharp anyway!



      <b>Questions for the authors</b>



      Superficially, it could be imagined that the more stable an axonal microtubule the better, since they are so crucial for axonal transport. Yet, this is clearly not the case, otherwise the state of dynamic equilibrium would not have evolved. Does this new model for selection of orientation shed any light on what that advantage of the dynamic equilibrium is?



      Studies of shrinkage events are so far limited to shrinkage from the distal end. Is there any contribution also from severing and how could that be measured?



      If +end-out microtubules at the distal end have unbounded growth what eventually stops them? Something must do this in the end because otherwise a mature axon would be clogged with lots of microtubules extending right up to the distal tip. Is this one of the functions of severing?



      In Fig 3b and c, there seems to be not only a decrease in + end-out growth distances but an increase in the growth of – end out microtubules. The same is true in Fig 3j and k when p150 is disrupted. Are these consistent observations and what could explain them? It would seem more likely that these interventions would disrupt microtubule growth regardless of orientation? 



      To what extent do you think similar mechanisms may operate in mature axons, or is this phenomenon limited to axon growth stages? At the very least it seems likely that they also recur during axon regeneratio but in this context it would be very interesting to know if there are CNS/PNS differences in vertebrates given the difference in axon regeneration.

    abstract: The Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) cycle is arguably the most critical
      metabolic cycle in physiology and exists as an essential interface
      coordinating cellular metabolism, bioenergetics, and redox homeostasis.
      Despite decades of research, a comprehensive investigation into the
      consequences of TCA cycle dysfunction remains elusive. Here, we targeted
      two TCA cycle enzymes, fumarate hydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase
      (SDH), and combined metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses
      to fully appraise the consequences of TCA cycle inhibition (TCAi) in
      kidney epithelial cells. Our comparative approach shows that TCAi elicits
      a convergent rewiring of redox and amino acid metabolism dependent on the
      activation of ATF4 and the integrated stress response (ISR). Furthermore,
      we also uncover a divergent metabolic response, whereby acute FHi, but not
      SDHi, can maintain asparagine levels via reductive carboxylation and
      maintenance of cytosolic aspartate synthesis. Our work highlights an
      important interplay between the TCA cycle, redox biology and amino acid
      homeostasis.

    title: Predicting COVID-19 malignant progression with AI techniques
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: >-
      Background and purposeThe worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) greatly challenges public medical systems. With limited medical
      resources, the treatment priority is determined by the severity of
      patients. However, many mild outpatients quickly deteriorate into
      severe/critical stage. It is crucial to early identify them and give
      timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality.
      This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with
      potential malignant progression.


      MethodsA total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at the severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared. Both multivariate logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models, with their area under ROC curves (AUC) compared.


      ResultsMultivariate logistic regression depicted 6 risk factors for malignant progression: age >55years (OR 5.334, 95%CI 1.8-15.803), comorbid with hypertension (OR 5.093, 95%CI 1.236-20.986), a decrease of albumin (OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.216-13.223), a decrease of lymphocyte (OR 3.459, 95%CI 1.067-11.209), the progressive consolidation from CT1 to CTsevere (OR 1.235, 95%CI 1.018-1.498), and elevated HCRP (OR 1.015, 95%CI 1.002-1.029); and one protective factor: the presence of fibrosis at CT1 (OR 0.656, 95%CI 0.473-0.91). By combining the clinical data and the temporal information of the CT data, our deep learning-based models achieved the best AUC of 0.954, which outperformed logistic regression (AUC: 0.893),


      ConclusionsOur deep learning-based methods can identify the mild patients who are easy to deteriorate into severe/critical cases efficiently and accurately, which undoubtedly helps to optimize the treatment strategy, reduce mortality, and relieve the medical pressure.

    title: "Breakthrough Symptomatic COVID-19 Infections Leading to Long Covid:
      Report from Long Covid Facebook Group Poll"
    category: epidemiology
    abstract: Vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing
      COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, a question remains whether
      vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of
      SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the
      Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on
      patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that
      asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949
      people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date.
      While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate
      rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to
      determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after
      breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases
      are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group
      (~169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll,
      44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that
      the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported
      to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.

    title: Six Month Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine
    category: infectious-diseases
    abstract: "Background: BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle-formulated,
      nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encoding a prefusion-stabilized,
      membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. BNT162b2 is highly
      efficacious against COVID-19 and is currently authorized for emergency use
      or conditional approval worldwide. At the time of authorization, data
      beyond 2 months post-vaccination were unavailable. Methods: In an ongoing,
      placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multinational, pivotal efficacy
      study, 44,165 [&ge;]16-year-old participants and 2,264 12-15-year-old
      participants were randomized to receive 2 doses, 21 days apart, of 30 g
      BNT162b2 or placebo. Study endpoints reported here are vaccine efficacy
      (VE) against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and safety data, both up to 6
      months post-vaccination. Results: BNT162b2 continued to be safe and well
      tolerated. Few participants had adverse events leading to study
      withdrawal. VE against COVID-19 was 91% (95% CI 89.0-93.2) through up to 6
      months of follow-up, among evaluable participants and irrespective of
      previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE of 86%-100% was seen across countries
      and in populations with diverse characteristics of age, sex,
      race/ethnicity, and COVID-19 risk factors in participants without evidence
      of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. VE against severe disease was 97% % (95%
      CI 80.3-99.9). In South Africa, where the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern,
      B.1.351 (beta), was predominant, 100% (95% CI 53.5, 100.0) VE was
      observed. Conclusion: With up to 6 months of follow-up and despite a
      gradually declining trend in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable
      safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19.

    title: "Self-reported real-world safety and reactogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines:
      An international vaccine-recipient survey."
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: "Background: The safety of COVID-19 vaccines has been demonstrated in
      selected populations in recent studies, but more data in specific groups
      is needed to inform vaccine choice and health policy. Objectives: An
      international, online survey was conducted to compare the safety,
      tolerability and reactogenicity of available COVID-19 vaccines in
      different recipient groups. Methods: This survey was launched in February
      2021, for 11 days. Recipients of a first COVID-19 vaccine dose [&ge;]7
      days prior to survey completion were eligible. The incidence and severity
      of vaccination side effects were assessed. Results: Survey was completed
      by 2,002 respondents, of whom 26.6% had prior COVID-19 infection (68.8%
      laboratory confirmed). Prior COVID-19 infection was associated with
      increased risk of any side effect (risk ratio 1.08, 95% confidence
      intervals [1.05-1.11]), fever (2.24 [1.86-2.70]), breathlessness (2.05
      [1.28-3.29]), flu-like illness (1.78 [1.51-2.10]), fatigue (1.34
      [1.20-1.49]) and local reactions (1.10 [1.06-1.15]). It was also
      associated with increased risk of severe side effects, leading to hospital
      care (1.56 [1.14-2.12]). While mRNA vaccines were associated with a higher
      incidence of any side effect (1.06 [1.01-1.11]) compared to viral
      vector-based vaccines, these were generally milder (p<0.001), mostly local
      reactions. Importantly, mRNA vaccine-recipients reported considerably
      lower incidence of systemic reactions (RR<0.6) including anaphylaxis,
      swelling, flu-like illness, breathlessness and fatigue, and of side
      effects requiring hospital care (0.42 [0.31-0.58]). Conclusion: For the
      first time, our study links prior COVID-19 illness with increased
      incidence of vaccination side effects and demonstrates that mRNA vaccines
      cause milder, less frequent systemic side effects, but more local
      reactions."

    title: A geospatial mapping pipeline for ecologists
    category: ecology
    abstract: Geospatial modelling can give fundamental insights in the biogeography
      of life, providing key information about the living world in current and
      future climate scenarios. Emerging statistical and machine learning
      approaches can help us to generate new levels of predictive accuracy in
      exploring the spatial patterns in ecological and biophysical processes.
      Although these statistical models cannot necessarily represent the
      essential mechanistic insights that are needed to understand global
      biogeochemical processes under ever-changing environmental conditions,
      they can provide unparalleled predictive insights that can be useful for
      exploring the variation in biophysical processes across space. As such,
      these emerging tools can be a valuable approach to complement existing
      mechanistic approaches as we aim to understand the biogeography of Earth's
      ecosystems. Here, we present a comprehensive methodology that efficiently
      handles large datasets to produce global predictions. This mapping
      pipeline can be used to generate quantitative, spatially explicit
      predictions, with a particular emphasis on spatially-explicit insights
      into the evaluation of model uncertainties and inaccuracies.

    title: The epithelial-specific ER stress sensor IRE1β enables host-microbiota
      crosstalk to affect colon goblet cell development
    category: cell-biology
    abstract: Epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal and
      respiratory tracts uniquely express IRE1{beta} (Ern2), a paralogue of the
      most evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1.
      How IRE1{beta} functions at the host-environment interface and why a
      second IRE1 paralogue evolved remain incompletely understood. Using
      conventionally raised and germ-free Ern2-/- mice, we found that IRE1{beta}
      was required for microbiota-induced goblet cell maturation and mucus
      barrier assembly in the colon. This occurred only after colonization of
      the alimentary tract with normal gut microflora, which induced IRE1{beta}
      expression. IRE1{beta} acted by splicing Xbp1 mRNA to expand ER function
      and prevent ER stress in goblet cells. Although IRE1 can also splice Xbp1
      mRNA, it did not act redundantly to IRE1{beta} in this context. By
      regulating assembly of the colon mucus layer, IRE1{beta} further shaped
      the composition of the gut microbiota. Mice lacking IRE1{beta} had a
      dysbiotic microbial community that failed to induce goblet cell
      development when transferred into germ-free wild type mice. These results
      show that IRE1{beta} evolved at mucosal surfaces to mediate crosstalk
      between gut microbes and the colonic epithelium required for normal
      homeostasis and host defense.

      This study takes on the interesting question of mouse Ern2's role in
      goblet cell development and function, mucous layer integrity and the
      intestinal host-microbe interface.

      The emphasis, understandably, is on the mechanistic basis of the fitness-benefit arising from the duplication of the ancestral gene that gave rise to the two ERN paralogues: the broadly expressed ERN1 and mucous producing secretory epithelium-selective ERN2 of vertebrates.

      The finding that epithelial-selective depletion of mouse Xbp1, phenocopies the consequences of germline deletion of Ern2 is taken as evidence that Ern2 exerts at least some of its effects in goblet cells, via XBP1 - an effector common to the products of both ERN genes (IRE1a and IRE1b). This conclusion is plausible, but the data presented in figure 1A and 3A also suggests that the consequences of XBP1 depletion in terms of Alcian Blue positive cell number are 2X more severe than those of Ern2 deletion (~0.17 cells per crypt in wildtype, versus ~0.12 in the Ern2∆ and ~0.06 in the XBP1∆). This may arise from XBP1 having a broad role in tissue development, with secondary consequences on goblet cells, but may also arise from a contribution of IRE1a (the product of the Ern1 gene) to XBP1 splicing in goblet cells - in other words reflecting functional redundancy between the two ERN isoforms in mucous producing cells. The latter possibility seems at odds with the emphasis in the abstracts on non-redundancy of the two isoforms, which suggests important qualitative differences between the two, whereas the two genes may in fact be pullin.g in the same direction, in so far as their effector functions are concerned.

    abstract: The Major Transitions in evolution include events and processes that
      result in the emergence of new levels of biological individuality. For
      collectives to undergo Darwinian evolution, their traits must be
      heritable, but the emergence of higher-level heritability is poorly
      understood and has long been considered a stumbling block for nascent
      evolutionary transitions. A change in the means by which genetic
      information is utilized and transmitted has been presumed necessary. Using
      analytical models, synthetic biology, and biologically-informed
      simulations, we explored the emergence of trait heritability during the
      evolution of multicellularity. Contrary to existing theory, we show that
      no additional layer of genetic regulation is necessary for traits of
      nascent multicellular organisms to become heritable; rather, heritability
      and the capacity to respond to natural selection on multicellular-level
      traits can arise ''for free.'' In fact, we find that a key emergent
      multicellular trait, organism size at reproduction, is usually more
      heritable than the underlying cell-level trait upon which it is based,
      given reasonable assumptions.

    title: No evidence of human genome integration of SARS-CoV-2 found by long-read
      DNA sequencing
    category: genomics
    abstract: A recent study proposed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
      2 (SARS-CoV-2) hijacks the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition machinery to
      integrate into the DNA of infected cells. If confirmed, this finding could
      have significant clinical implications. Here, we applied deep (>50x)
      long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing to HEK293T cells
      infected with SARS-CoV-2, and did not find the virus integrated into the
      genome. By examining ONT data from separate HEK293T cultivars, we
      completely resolved 78 L1 insertions arising in vitro in the absence of L1
      overexpression systems. ONT sequencing applied to hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      positive liver cancer tissues located a single HBV insertion. These
      experiments demonstrate reliable resolution of retrotransposon and
      exogenous virus insertions via ONT sequencing. That we found no evidence
      of SARS-CoV-2 integration suggests such events are, at most, extremely
      rare in vivo, and therefore are unlikely to drive oncogenesis or explain
      post-recovery detection of the virus.

      Central to the authors’ conclusions is their Fig. 3A (middle panel) which,
      however, is misleading: by including the y-axis origin (0) the authors
      unrealistically imply that they had an unlimited number n of ONT sequence
      reads. 

      While apparently they do not report this number for their own experiments, it can be estimated from their Table S1 (n ~ Yield/N50).



      It then follows that in Fig. 3A (middle) their data only gives a non-zero upper bound (< 1/n) for the “Proportion of total ONT sequence (%)”, which here becomes about two orders of magnitude smaller than the levels reported by Zhang et al. (to which they directly compare).



      In summary, their main message then boils down to the following: without strong over-expression of L1 (as done in Zhang et al.), and without proper controls of other relevant virus/host factors, the fraction of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genomic integration events observed is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the one reported Zhang et al.



      This finding certainly does not invalidate (or “contradict") the important and far-reaching result reported by the Jaenisch group.

    title: Can the microbiome influence host evolutionary trajectories?
    category: evolutionary-biology
    abstract: The microbiome shapes many traits in hosts, but we still do not
      understand how it influences host evolution. To impact host evolution, the
      microbiome must be heritable and have phenotypic effects on the host.
      However, the complex inheritance and context-dependence of the microbiome
      challenges traditional models of organismal evolution. Here, we take a
      multifaceted approach to identify conditions in which the microbiome
      influences host evolutionary trajectories. We explore quantitative genetic
      models to highlight how microbial inheritance and phenotypic effects can
      modulate host evolutionary responses to selection. We synthesize the
      literature across diverse taxa to find common scenarios of microbiome
      driven host evolution. First, hosts may leverage locally adapted microbes,
      increasing survivorship in stressful environments. Second, microbial
      variation may increase host phenotypic variation, enabling exploration of
      novel fitness landscapes. We further illustrate these effects by
      performing a meta-analysis of artificial selection in Drosophila, finding
      that bacterial diversity also frequently responds to host selection. We
      conclude by outlining key avenues of research and experimental procedures
      to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between hosts and
      microbiomes. By synthesizing perspectives through multiple conceptual and
      analytical approaches, we show how microbiomes can influence the
      evolutionary trajectories of hosts.

    title: COVID-19 vaccines and evidence-based medicine
    category: public-and-global-health
    abstract: OBJECTIVE To clarify efficacy, effectiveness, and harm of available
      vaccines for COVID-19, using measures in evidence-based medicine (EBM)
      that, in addition to relative risk reduction, consider absolute risk
      reduction and variations in baseline risks. DESIGN Systematic review of
      studies that have considered impacts of vaccines in relation to baseline
      risks. Calculation of risk reduction and harms from published data in two
      random controlled trials and one population-based implementation study.
      Analysis of risk reductions in geographical areas with varying baseline
      risks. Comparison of results concerning COVID-19 vaccine and selected
      prior vaccines. SETTING Random controlled trials of Pfizer and Moderna
      vaccines in multiple countries; population-based study using Pfizer
      vaccine in Israel. Counties with varying baseline risks in the United
      States; states with varying baseline risks in India. PARTICIPANTS 43,448
      and 30,420 subjects in the random controlled trials; 1,198,236 subjects in
      the population-based study. INTERVENTIONS Multi-site random controlled
      trials of vaccine efficacy; population-based administration of vaccine
      with determination of effectiveness by comparison of vaccinated and
      unvaccinated subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk reduction
      (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to be vaccinated to
      prevent one symptomatic infection (NNV), absolute risk of the intervention
      (ARI), and number needed to harm (NNH). RESULTS A systematic review of
      literature in medicine and public health showed very few reports regarding
      ARR, NNV, ARI, and NNH; use of these indicators to compare benefits versus
      harms; or analysis of these EBM indicators in the context of varying
      baseline risks. From data in the two random controlled trials and one
      population-based study, calculated ARR was approximately 1 percent (as
      compared to RRR of 50 to 95 percent), and NNV was in the range of 100 to
      500. In comparisons of ARR and NNV versus ARI and NNH, benefits and harms
      were not markedly different. From a sensitivity analysis of ARR and NNV in
      population groups with varying baseline risks, the effectiveness of
      vaccines as measured by ARR and NNV was substantially higher in regions
      with high as compared to low baseline risks. The ARR for COVID-19 vaccines
      was somewhat smaller and the NNV somewhat larger than achieved by some
      vaccines to prevent influenza and smallpox. CONCLUSION The efficacy and
      effectiveness of major COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by RRR, are
      impressive. As measured by ARR and NNV, which take into account variation
      in baseline risks, the effectiveness of the vaccines is substantially
      higher in areas with higher baseline risks. This finding can contribute to
      educational efforts, informed consent procedures, and policy making about
      priorities for vaccine distribution, especially under conditions of access
      barriers linked to poverty and inequality. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS
      TOPIC Major COVID-19 vaccines so far have shown impressive efficacy in
      random controlled trials and effectiveness in population-based studies. To
      determine efficacy and effectiveness, these studies have used relative
      risk reduction (RRR), which shows the difference in event rate between
      those receiving and not receiving a vaccine. Reports of efficacy and
      effectiveness have not yet clarified other key indicators from
      evidence-based medicine (EBM) that consider variations baseline risks.
      Such indicators include measures of benefits such as absolute risk
      reduction (ARR) and number needed to be vaccinated (NNV), as well as
      measures of harm such as absolute risk of the intervention (ARI) and
      number needed to harm (NNH). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS For COVID-19 vaccines,
      calculated ARR is somewhat lower and NNV somewhat higher than for certain
      prior vaccines such as those for influenza and smallpox. Indicators of
      harm for COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARI and NNH, appear to be in
      the same order of magnitude as indicators of benefit such as ARR and NNV.
      The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARR and NNV, is
      substantially higher in geographical areas with high baseline risk,
      compared to areas with low baseline risk. These findings can assist in
      informed consent procedures, educational efforts, and priority setting in
      policies about distribution of vaccines, especially in the context of
      access barriers related to poverty and inequality.

      "We obtained the baseline risks for selected U.S. counties from the Johns
       Hopkins University dashboard and for selected states of India from the 
      New York Times dashboard"


      JHU has received well in excess of $100,000,000 from the BMGF.


      Is this a potential conflict of interest ?


      Many Thanks.
